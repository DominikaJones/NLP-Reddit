"Curious if using game sharing on the Xbox one I can play the same game with my brother at the same time online My brother lives in Massachusetts and I recently moved to Maine. Having moved away we had to split up our games and I just bought a new Xbox one. For the digital games however, we will need to game share. I was curious if we can play with/against each other online if we are sharing the same game. Or is it worth buying a second copy of the same game",xboxone,0

"Am I crazy or is this messed up? I purchased an Xbox one controller from Best Buy Canada back in 2018, and me being the super warranty freak I am, I made sure I purchased the longest warranty I could for it, just in case something went wrong, free replacement am I right?!

Okay now fast forward to today, 2020.

RIP Xbox one controller. 

But it's okay! I have my original box, with the original receipt still inside! And it doesn't even expire until March 2021! I thought all is good.

I went to best buy with my boyfriend, but I stayed in the car while he went in to do the quick exchange.

But it wasn't quick. And he also left the store with the broken product.

I was very confused, but my boyfriend explained to me that they said that there was nothing they can do in-store about it, apparently. That we have to call the phone number they wrote on the receipt and go that route.

Kinda cheesed and still a little confused at this point, I call anyways and the customer service person told me this:

""The only thing we are able to do is send you an electronic gift card for the price of the controller you paid for originally""

But wait guys...

When I purchased the Xbox One Controller + Cable for Windows the original price in 2018 was $64.99

Guess how much they are now? Well... they aren't. Best Buy does not physically sell this product anymore. 

But, on the Best Buy website, online on from a third party, for the exact same thing it's $94.99... Well actually, it's $103.99, but it's $9 off right now.

And the closest thing I can get to my product that Best Buy actually sells is cheapest $121.99 (because it's on sale right now)

Okay okay okay... So let me get this straight.

I get a gift card for only $64.99, wasted $19.99 extra on a warranty and now have to spend an additional potentially $30-$57.

So I would potentially be $76.99 plus tax, in the hole, just to get a ""FULL"" replacement. (I included the price of the warranty because I am not getting my money back for the warranty)

I have the original Geek Squad pamphlet that was printed in 2014, and given to me in 2018 when I purchased this product: stating full replace for faulty or defective products while under this warranty.

When I read the words ""full replacement"", there is nothing in those words that suggests to me that I will need to pay a single dime, let alone $76.99.

So... I don't know if it's just because I'm so broke poor that I notice when I lose even $1, because that could sometimes make or break if I can afford rent or not, so something like this is overwhelming for that reason, or if this is actually outrageous and wrong?

How can this be right? How can this be justified?

How can this company tell me that just because they don't sell the product that I still have a fully valid warranty for, cannot be replaced or fixed free of additional charges, even though I fully paid for a warranty stating they would do that.

I don't understand how it's my fault the controller broke out of my control, and can't even get the exact same one for the same price? I didn't ask for prices to be jacked up. I don't even care for an upgraded controller, I literally just want the one I paid for just to replaced with one that works for free. But now I have to spend more money then I originally even paid for the controller!

What's your thoughts? What should I do? How would you handle this?",xboxone,0
"How do you guys hear your own voice when talking with a headset on? How do you guys hear your own voice when talking with a headset on?

On the Xbox One, I used a headset that didn’t seal around my ear so I heard the outside world (and my own voice) easily. It was the Turtle Beach Xo Ones. 

In the last few weeks, I’ve spent several hundred dollars buying and returning very many headsets, and I’ve come down to the SteelSeries Arctic 1 wireless. BUT every one of these has one big issue I cannot get passed. I can’t hear my own voice when I’m talking. All the headsets that seal your ear off and have Passive noise cancelation make it so that I can’t hear myself talk when there’s game audio. 

The Xbox and some of these headsets DO have mic monitoring which is supposed to resolve the issue. But the mic monitoring is so incredibly subtle that I genuinely cannot tell if it’s on unless I tap directly on the microphone to hear the feedback. The monitoring is lower in volume than the game sounds, which defeats the purpose of it entirely. 

When I talk without being able to hear my own voice over the game sounds, I have difficulty talking (which is normal). I have to lower the game sound immensely to hear myself over the passive noise cancelation of the headphones. 

How do you guys do it?
Thanks in advance.",xboxone,0

So my question is wich one should i choose, i can manage to get an 800 dollar pc, but as i understand it won't last as much as an xbox and it won't be as powerful, but it will run other apps. Or i can buy an xbox series x and game with high quality 4k 60 fps ray tracing!!!,i also have game pass, but i won't be able to run other apps. Maybe xbox will support pc apps in the future or is that not possible?",xboxone,0

"Console release problems could be easily fixed by allowing backorder purchases. Why aren't they? PS5 and Xbox Series X/S are in high demand.  Everybody wants one.  Scalpers and bots are going nuts.  Why is this such a mess?  

Answer is simple- because there are no preorders/backorders.  

ANY other product launch, it sells out and then it's backordered; people who backorder get a spot in the production queue and then when stock arrives their order is filled.  

That would be easy to do here.  'Order now and your order is expected to ship on _____ date'.  Put your money down and you go in a nice orderly queue.  Yes it'll probably stretch out to January pretty fast, but that's better than having stock snapped up by scalper bots.

"Potential Issue with Using Disc based DLC When You Have GamePass Hi, so I hope this doesn't come off as asking for tech help because I'm not, I more want to foster some discussion around an issue which admittedly probably only affects a small portion of players at this point. Recently I started a playthrough of one of my all-time favorite RPGs Fallout: New Vegas. I've had a physical copy of the ultimate edition since the Xbox 360 days which contains all of the DLC on a 2nd disc. The problem is, since I have GamePass the GamePass ""version"" of the license always boots up after the Xbox detects that it's Fallout: New Vegas in the disc drive. It doesn't matter if you use disc 1 or 2 the game just boots up so now you don't get the option to install the DLC. As far as I can tell, others have found work arounds in the past like uninstalling the game and putting in disc 2, but when I tried that my Xbox just said that it couldn't read the disc. Putting in disc 2 and navigating to the in game store and the Xbox store doesn't work either, I was only given the option to purchase the DLC. I believe they're doing this because you can do GamePass daily challenges now (or whatever they are called) and they want you to be able to do the challenges for games that you own that are also on GamePass if you're a GamePass subscriber which is cool, but unfortunate in this instance.

Ultimately I just bought a digital version of all the DLC since it's 70% off this week and I could have it all for like $9 but I was still a little disappointed since it appears that backwards compatibility, physical discs, and GamePass licenses don't all seem to function together right now. Again, I acknowledge that it's a very small set of gamers that will be affected by this, but hopefully it's an issue that is fixed in the future. And if you intend to get GamePass, make sure you install any disc based DLC on games that you already own which are also on GamePass first.",xboxone,0

Any original players of Championship Manager on the OG xbox?

The past few years I'd search Football Manager on the xbox store hoping it'd just magically show up as a backwards compatible title, so I was pretty excited when this most current version of Football Manager news came out saying it was coming back to xbox.

If you don't know what it is, it's a management simulation ""game,"" where you're the manager of a soccer team. You can buy and sell players and mess with tactics, all so you can win and move up in prestige. There's graphics, but that's not important. It's mostly about numbers. Watching numbers go up and down. 

If you like role playing, this is the ultimate role playing game. You can mold your local squad/team into the champions of the world. You can release players you hate. You can nurture young players to be the next Messi. You can send Ronaldo back to Man United. It's a ton of fun and can really get its claws on you.

"Move from Live Gold on my Microsoft Account to Games Pass Ultimate on my son's account I have had an Xbox Live Gold subscription using my Microsoft Account for many years. Although I primarily had it for online multiplayer, I've been pretty diligent about making sure to get the free ""Games with Gold"" games each month since that benefit was first introduced. In that time, my kids have grown to where they now play games. This has worked fine with our single Xbox One.

My oldest son would like us to upgrade from Live Gold to Game Pass Ultimate for both the subscribed games and the cloud streaming benefit. I had told him I would do that as part of our purchase of an Xbox Series X by buying an Xbox All Access bundle. Unfortunately, we haven't had any luck in actually finding that in stock anywhere and my Live Gold subscription expired on 11/28, so I went ahead and purchased an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription yesterday.

I quickly discovered that the cloud streaming feature is not shareable and only works using my Microsoft Account. I don't game on my phone, so I have no use for that benefit. I'm thinking of canceling the Games Pass Ultimate subscription on my Microsoft Account and instead purchasing it through my son's Microsoft Account. He would then be able to use the cloud streaming on his phone and we would still be able to share the rest of the subscription benefits on our Xbox One.

I saw in the ""Games with Gold"" FAQ that while the Xbox 360 titles will work even if the Live Gold subscription is canceled, the Xbox One titles won't. My question is, if there is no Gold or Game Pass Ultimate subscription on my Microsoft Account, but there is one shared on our Xbox One through my son's account, will the Xbox One titles that were originally obtained through my account remain playable?

Of course, this does nothing to solve the complication of when we get the Xbox Series X and have two Xboxes in the house. Or when my other children get old enough to want to be able to want cloud streaming. Microsoft really needs to create an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Family Plan.",xboxone,0

"It's time for a GamePass Ultimate Family Subscription (also improved license management) We are now a two generation gaming household.  I have 3 children and each of them now  enjoy playing Xbox with each other and me.  We are now also a 3 Xbox family.  My Series X, a Xbox One X in the bonus room, and an OG Day 1 Xbox One that lives in my kids room.  When we only had 2 Xboxes  it wasn't that bad.  I have GP Ultimate for myself and subscribed my son's account to the second console.  My account is homed to the Series X and my son's account to the OG Xbox.  Now that we have 3 consoles I find that only streamlined way is to subscribe yet another account to GP Ultimate.  


It's not about the combined $45/mo subscription price.  It's more the growing complexity of managing multiple subscriptions and then making sure each of our 4 accounts has proper access to the games across each console.  It would be much easier and family friendlier to have a Single GamePass Ultimate Subscription that could grant access to Live Services and Gamepass across more than one account.  I'd pay $50/mo just for the convenience of a single subscription.  


As an extension having a away to share purchased games within your Xbox Family would be great as well.  Again, the idea isn't to buy the newest CoD and then have more than one person play it at the same time, but to be able to buy say 2 or 3 licenses and have each family member be able to use that license.  It would be identical to buying physical copies of a game and shuttling them from console to console, just with digital purchases and limited to your Xbox One Family accounts.  I gave up on physical media not long after the Launch of Xbox One.  It was just too easy to lose a game from loss or physical damage and since the games have to be installed/downloaded even with a physical disc, decided to go full digital.  It's much easier to play games this way anyway as I don't have walk my disc from console to console or remember to bring it with me to a friends house.  I think this is part of what Microsoft envisioned with the DRM planned for the Xbox One Launch back in 2013 but they did such a bad job of marketing and explaining it that it was not understood and such backlash required it being removed entirely before launch.",xboxone,0

"Problem with surround sound on games for xbox series x with Marantz 7015 I'm having a lot of problems with this right now. I'm using eARC as it's the only way to have 4k120hz with VRR with a surround sound because there was a mishap with the chip set compatability with the receivers and xbox system. I used to have an Onkyo TxNR676 and I would leave the audio to 7.1 uncompressed for gaming. The onkyo would register it as ""multichannel"" and i would have surround sound as you'd expect. Well, I upgraded my receiver to a Marantz 7015 and I set the audio on my new xbox series x to 7.1 uncompressed. When playing a game the receiver does not have a ""multichannel"" option even though it says it is when PCM content is playing. It only gives me dolby digital, DTS Neural and virtual X, and auro 2d as the surround options. When I use any one of these on my receiver, it's almost like a channel is missing entirely because there is some audio that is supposed to be there but is not. There will be music or some kind of background noise on the surround speakers, but none of the surround sound is actually there. If something explodes behind me you can't hear anything of it at all. It's like it just disappears because it's mixed in with the audio that wasn't played. I tried using ""direct"" mode and even ""auto"" mode, but when I do that it picks it up as regular 2.2 stereo. I tried it with my Xbox one x and the same issue occurred. I really don't want to go through the trouble of hooking up my old receiver to see if the problem still persists but I really don't want to..  However I think this is a problem with my AVR. The only think that actually works the way it's supposed to is if I change the xbox to dolby atmos but then it creates an unacceptable audio lag so I can't use it. Why can't anything ever be easy... Does anybody else have this problem? I don't get how I can spend 5x more on an AVR and the cheap ass one would work better..",xboxone,0

"I Want to Hear YOUR Opinion (yes, really) I have been trying to find more games for my wife to play lately and have been having a rough time. 



Some relative background info: 

She plays exclusively on her Xbox One X

She prefers to have the option to play with me in co-op

She is relatively new to gaming and can be rather picky

She has Game Pass and further access to my library of 800+ games

She, currently, hates anime

She gets anxiety rather easily and gives up on challenging games if there is nothing else she can do in them

She really enjoys anything related to horror, cults, or the supernatural



Here is a list of some of her most played games and what I believe she enjoys about them.

Far Cry 5 - familiar setting, cult based story, easily followed checklist of objectives, co-op, tons of side objectives (loves her sniper rifle and shotgun)

Dead By Daylight - horror aspects, co-op as survivor, quick and varied matches, leveling system (mains Trapper, Myers, and Legion)

Deep Rock Galactic - destructible terrain, co-op, varied mission types, clear progression through character ranks/weapon mods (favorite character is Driller)

Payday 2 - liked stealthing, co-op, clear player progression, fun builds, lots of different missions (played up to mayhem with me on loud and death sentence on stealth)

Slay the Spire - not 100% sure but I believe she mostly likes how different every run can be and all the varied items she has to interact with



Finally, a few other games she has already played (and enjoyed at least a little) includes the following: Minecraft, Hunt: Showdown, Trials Rising, Rock Band 4, Bioshock, Super Lucky's Take, Journey to the Savage Planet, Remnant: From the Ashes, Resident Evil 7, Borderlands, Layers of Fear, and Spyro Reignited Trilogy.

"Looking for a new online time sink (after destiny2 and gta online) Ok so I'm playing games only for 2-3 years now, gta online was my first game and I spent years grinding to get all the properties and vehicles I wanted, still playing when new missions are coming out.

Then I moved to Destiny 2 and after about (amazingly fun) 6-7 months I finally got all the weapons and armor I wanted, now I just don't have any new goals in the game, until next DLC I guess.

I don't like playing ""offline"" games, it feels weird to me, I'm mostly a co-op player.

I tried The Division 2 and it was fun but I didn't get hooked to it.

I got Titanfall 2 and Rainbowsix Siege but I guess they're more of a PvP kind of online and less co-op.

I loved playing Saint Row IV but again, it's a solo/campaign game so it can't be a time sink for me.

Any suggestions?

Many thanks!",xboxone,0

"Looking for a premium controller and headset. Lets talk controllers first. I just got my Series X and I'm looking for a new controller. Something that feels premium and worth every penny. I was about to pull the trigger on the Elite V2 but I saw the rating and reviews due to the poor quality control. I have an original Elite and I've gone through three of them due to stick drift. It appears that the Elite V2 suffers from the same poor quality control issues. I do not want to spend that much money on a controller just to have to send it back and wait for a replacement. 

[The Razer Wolverine Ultimate](https://www.razer.com/shop/console/console-controllers?query=:newest:category:console-controllers:controllers-platform:PC%2B%26%2BXbox%2BSeries%2BX%7CS:controllers-connectivity:Wireless) is the next contender but I want it it be wireless. The problem is, every review I have seen says it's WIRED. But if you go to Razer's website, and select the wireless filter, the RWU is displayed...... but when you scroll down to tech specs, it says battery life is ""n/a"".... so not really sure what to believe there. If it's not wireless, I don't want it.

I was looking at the Scuff website and they just don't seem to be worth the money. They APPEAR to be regular wireless Xbox Controllers with some paddles on the back. I do not have experiences with Scuff so I can't comment on if this is the case, but they're definitely in Elite Controller pricing territory before adding customization. 

If anyone can recommend a great premium wireless controller please recommend one.

Next let's talk wireless headsets. I came from PC. I have an Xbox One but I just used the over the single ear headset that used to come with the console. I have heard that Turtle Beach has become a less reliable brand over the years, but I remember them being the go to brand for the longest time. I have no starting point here so I'm very open to suggestions. If anyone can help out please comment below.

"Games Stuttering on External HD First time owning a console in a long time, so apologies if this is a simple fix/dumb question.

I have a Series X and purchased an external WD 5 TB HDD, purchased the same day. Games were playing fine from the external HDD over the past week or so but tonight they started being choppy. Audio cuts out and the games freeze for a few seconds every couple of minutes. This happened with all 6 or 7 games I tried on the external drive. Games on the internal SSD work fine. 

Is this a common issue? Is there a potential solution? Given that I have a data cap for my internet but I get a free overage month, I went ahead and used my free overage month to download everything I'd possibly want to play off Gamepass so I'd rather not have to reformat this as a potential solution.

Im looking for a kids (mini) xbox one controller for a 3 year old. Had a look about and found some cool looking little things by rock candy or powera.

Only thing is I need a green controller - it looks like both companies did a green one but I cannot find it in stock anywhere.

Xbox elite 2 purchase best buy coverage Hey all. I'm looking to purchase a new elite 2 controller as my elite 1 is kicking the bucket (got about 4 years out of her though). I am aware of the precautions of the elite 2 and am looking at getting my elite 2 from best buy as I hear their service is great. I would purchase the 2 year geek squad warranty as it seems like a great deal because it 2 years I'm sure I could find some reason to replace it with a new one. So I'm just curious how hassle free is it to get these products replaced at best buy? Do they fight you on it at all if the product is overall fine still? Thanks!,xboxone,0

"Torn between buying a Series S or waiting Hey guys!  


I recently got a Xbox One S as a gift, got myself Ultimate Game Pass, am mainly PC gaming and used to play Playstation.  
Now I'm having a blast on all those games and Microsoft rewards (seriously what the hell are those options and games, it's too much! haha), controller feels kickass, great diversity of games between console and PC - but there is something of a heavy dilemma right now.  


Since I got gifted the One S, I don't want to just put it away, but this year has been awful for me, I am not big on money, can't get a proper PC upgrade with all those shenanigans going on...  And with that, I am not planning to upgrade my PC to the raytracing gen anytime soon, too.   
But I am also a little spoiled because of PC. And I wanna do get something good for me.  


I don't use a TV, I got two monitors (both 1440p, one of them 144hz), and even though the One S is great, I could get a Series S + 500GB of external SSD (non scalper prices). With all those Game Pass games, I don't even need to buy any discs anymore.  


I would feel bad for the One S since it was a gift, but I am still heavily eyeing the Series S. I thought ""Hey, I can wait, it's fine, it's not like the prices are going to increase in the upcoming months for the Series S.""  
And yet, here I am , making a post like this.   


What are your thoughts on this? Shall I just wait, or do I bite the bullet and just friggin go for it? If nothing will change in the next 6 months, I might as well wait, don't you think? Maybe some of your comments will help me decide on this.

"Cannot change audio format output suddenly? Hi all

Suddenly DTS does not get transcoded to Dolby on my Xbox One X when watching BDs or UHDs.

Have checked settings, done a hard reboot, everything except a full reset of the unit.

Used to work fine about a fortnight ago, but I can now select Dolby as the Bitstream format, yet it definitely comes through as DTS, which my Sonos can’t play.

As such, I’ve settled for PCM 2.0, but it’s a little disappointing to say the least.

Anyone else encountered this issue, or can check their setup to see I’m not going crazy?

"[Series X] Headset Audio Mixer Greyed Out? As the title says, my audio mixer for my headset is greyed out on the Xbox, and the settings are defaulted to minimal audio/100% game 0% chat, meaning that in order to hear the people I'm playing with I've had to crank my headset to max on the adapter &amp; turn game sounds all the way down via in-game menus. I've seen suggestions regarding restarting my controller, unplugging the headset and plugging it in slowly etc but none of these seem to work. I can't see it being an issue with the headset, as I used this on my One X before the Series X dropped, and had no issues with audio mixing at all. I also use a Turtle Beach Headset Audio Controller, and maxing out the chat volume over game still has the game volume blasting out way over voice chat.

Does anybody have any idea how to fix this? Most of the games I play involve communication &amp; are typically loud and high action, so this is extremely frustrating.",xboxone,0

"I'm absolutely loving the Series S so far I was a little nervous getting the series s, as I could hardly afford that, let alone a series x, but oh my God I'm having a blast. The SSD is lightning quick, games feel so smooth, and the 4k upscale is sooo much better than the one S, which left games feeling blurry on my 4k TV.

Also how small this console is. Its absolutely tiny. I know everybody says that, but when I opened it, I couldn't believe it. Even my partner thought it was adorable how small it is. Its so easy to store anywhere, and I don't have much space so its absolutely perfect for that.

The only caveats being the 512 gb and I do kinda miss the disc drive. Its still such an amazing console, and it really does feel next gen. For those on the fence about the Series S, go for it. You really won't regret it, its absolutely fantastic! :)",xboxone,0

Hi, 

Thank you for your inquiry. This account received 14-Day communications suspension, on 11/26. This suspension was issued for spamming other users on the services by posting "" Buying all your blueprints (No black market blueprints please). Paying 1 credit per 1 blueprint. If you have 500 I can buy all 500. Or how many you have. Please remember to only add 20 blueprints per trade as there is a 24 item limit per trade and you cannot give 24 credits.”. While we do not discourage you from getting new fans of your content, we must take into account how users on the service perceive unsolicited advertisements like this. At this time, we have elected to keep this suspension in place.

What does that mean? There are so many posts in Rocket League LFG section filled with item trade requests. I don't advertise wtf, neither am i looking for fans lol.

"Seriously Xbox, after all these years.. Why the hell can’t you get the store page to function properly?

It’s rare the store page ever functions the way it’s intended.
Clicking on games, try to view the videos and it just shows the rating then goes to a black screen, but with the trailer audio still playing. Videos have always been a nightmare to get to play right, in every store layout you’ve had. This isn’t a new thing.

And all of a sudden it’s impossible to find reviews on so many games.
You expect me to believe there’s no reviews for Watch Dogs Legion yet? Assassins Creed Valhalla? Black Ops Cold War? Why hide them? Why make me go an additional step to get my phone and check reviews elsewhere?

If I go to the Game Pass tab on the main Home Screen, and click “All Console Games,” it says “Sorry we can’t show you Game Pass games right now”
So then I need to go into my games library &gt; full library &gt; Xbox game pass to see the same exact thing.

It just blows my mind that the first thing you’re showing customers when they’re considering spending money on your product, is always a pain in the ass to use, and needlessly creates additional steps for the customer to be able to decide on purchasing what you’re selling. And frustrates me enough to get on Reddit and type a big long rant just because I was looking through games on your store.

OH, and if I go to my “Recent Captures” from the guide menu, and watch a video, when I hit the B button to back out of that video it’d be sweet if it just went back to my recent captures, not clear back out of the menu back to the game or whatever I was in before going there.",xboxone,0

"Surprised my nephew with my console. He was overjoyed and I am even happier! I am a huge gamer but don’t have many friends or any family who play games. My brother and I have a strained relationship but I have a fine relationship with his family and his 6 year old son, “Calvin”.

I found out from my sister-in-law, that Calvin loves video games but has only ever gotten to play at a friends house, and since they aren’t going places due to COVID-19, he hadnt been able to play games at all this year and Calvin was pretty sad about it. 

They aren’t wealthy but could have been able to afford a game console, but didn’t ever do it since they don’t care about games.

I don’t have a Series S or X yet but I know that I want to get one next year. But I knew that it would make my nephew’s day/year if I gave him my Xbox and games.

The more I thought about it the more excited I became. I told my brother and SIL that I wanted to give it to Calvin as an early Christmas present.  They thanked me and said yes, but I could tell they didn’t “get” it. 

However, I didn’t really care what they thought, I just hoped Calvin would be interested. I definitely wasn’t expecting the absolute joy on his face when I gave it to him and the excitement I felt watching him play Lego Avengers surpassed almost any fun I’ve had playing a game.

I didn’t know my nephew very well before but now I feel like we have the beginnings of a real relationship. I told him he could FaceTime me if he needed help! My brother and SIL both seemed pleased about how happy it made Calvin too. 

I don’t have any Xbox right now but It’s worth it!

"Xbox and PlayStation unboxing thoughts and experiences So my experiences opening both systems is that Microsoft thoughout the consumer experience a bit more. The packaging was “more premium” and made it feel more exciting to open. The PlayStation felt rushed and not thought out at all. I feel like if both systems were dropped in box from 5 feet Xbox would be way way way better off than the PlayStation would. I mean, they would probably both not fuction due to how heavy they are. But I feel like the PlayStation would be destroyed... Xbox would be lightly bumped. 

Xbox set up was a breeze and allowed for me to stream it with out any issues and it was done through the Xbox companion app. You don’t need to do this method but it was super simple and didn’t share my info on stream. 

Playstion setup was weird and I couldn’t figure out how to attach the base to the system. Where the screw was and how to “pop” out the little plastic piece from the bass. Once I did, the set up wouldn’t allow me to stream because I had to go through on ps5 set up to turn off the hdip or something so that it could be used through the elgato stream card... kinda stupid. Although set up allowed for PlayStation to install a game while setting up. Which is a neat touch. 

Once they were both set up I felt like Xbox seemed very similar to my Xbox one x but that’s okay because I know it and it’s familiar and I like it. But I didn’t get the “next gen” hype feeling around playing with the UI. It def. loads fast though and when putting my
Hand over the fan area feels a bit like a space heater. Which is great for winter. But I’d rather have the hot air outside rather than overheating the system. Also Xbox leaves finger smudges and hand prints. Which kinda sucks. The controller feels good. But is basically the same design. I do like the grippyness they’ve added to the back of the system and the triggers are nice and grippy as well. So that’s good! :). More of the same is always good. Just doesn’t feel innovative. New D pad is good but not sure I totally love it. 

The PlayStation, I just hate the way it looks. The system seems wonky on the stand, standing upright. Like I really wished they had figured out how to incorporate the disk drive into the black portion rather than slopping it on the side. Also it feels cheap. The plastic wings feel meh... I do like that it lights up around it and stuff though. But overall not impressed with system design. The UI did give me the next gen feeling though but to be honest I haven’t played with it much to see a whole bunch more. Been testing the Xbox more. The controller is neat but not sure how I like the bottom nubs, they are slightly cut off for smaller hands and kinda feel weird to hold. Haven’t tried all the next gen features on it yet. I feel as though the PlayStation was rushed. Idk. We’ll see. 

I can see myself using both systems but again will probably default more towards Xbox as it plays nicer with PC. 

Those are my thoughts so far! Wondering if you guys felt the same? Would love to hear your unboxing experiences.",xboxone,0

- unplugging and replugging mic
- replacing controller batteries
- updating controller with mic plugged in
- making sure mic is enabled in Xbox audio settings
- made sure NAT type was open
- made sure headset is not muted and game chat is    enabled on every game

From personal experience, or someone who is well versed in these retail warranties, do you know which one is best for a warranty? If you have something to share, please comment! I was leaning towards Walmart for the 4 year. Which one is best? Why should avoid a certain one?

What I know:
- Walmart has a 4 year extended warranty for approximately $70.
- Best Buy has a 2 year extended geek squad warranty for approximately $70.
- Costco has a free doubled extended warranty. (If I'm not mistaken).",xboxone,0

"any chance to get Dolby Atmos to work with an appropriate Bluetooth Headset? (3rd Party, not MS certified) Hey there,

so I've got myself a new bluetooth headset that is dolby atmos capable.

I can pair it with my TV and it works in TV mode, however it doesnt seem to work properly with the XBOX, the mic also does not get detected.

"Is there a trick to contacting Microsoft? It's all broken. I appreciate we are currently amidst a pandemic crossed with a product launch, so I understand official responses will be slow - however, how does anyone contact Microsoft with problems? Is there a bewitching hour where their customer support is online? A secret morse code i can tap on my keyboard? Do I need to draw a picture of Bill Gates whilst whistling the tune to the A-Team into a seashell? I am convinced their customer support exists, I just don't know how to find them.

Microsoft's online chat/callback system tells me I cannot contact them about ""this problem"" - but for argument sake, i think i've tried every combination in their dropdown list, from ""*whats a DVD*"", to ""*My xbox set my house on fire*"" - which leads me to believe its not that I can't contact *about that problem* \- but just that - **I can't contact them.**

I have a launch day xbox one series x. Truthfully - I was underwhelmed, *Warzone loads in about 3 seconds faster than it did on my old external ssd* \- but I know the gains don't come on launch day, they come when developers have had a chance to get the best out of the system. I fully got caught up in the hype. (The most impressive thing so far has been Forza Horizon load times.)

Since Launch, I've repeatedly had to reinstall games, as the console seems to want to update both the standard, and X/S versions of the games. Sometimes it shows X/S games without the X/S badge and offers me to download the (incredibly frustratingly, and definitely) already installed X/S version. This seems to affect the performance. Cold War non X/S runs at a horrible frame rate on the new console, for the record... Imagine a mashup between black ops, and the nightmare before christmas - but not in a good way.

I can't even complete Cold War, because when i get to the start of one of the last missions, it crashes so hard that it goes beyond simply dashboarding, and turns the console off entirely. Go hard, or go home... I guess.

I also have an issue where the controller will disconnect if the console is left on, i don't have it set to energy saving, and it happens with and without any external drives plugged in. 

When it does this, the console sync button doesn't work - you can hold it as long as you like, but it doesn't ever start the sync flashing light cycle - instead the console must be hard reset. I've tested this with additional controllers to rule that out, and a headset - My new xbox hates them all when it gets into one of its moods. All these devices work perfectly on my xbox one x which was forced into early retirement, yet may soon be getting an apology and a promotion back to its old job role.

I've also factory reset this console, which hasn't fixed the problems. Ive run it in 8 and 10bit colourspace on 4k. Ive run it on fixed IP/automatic IP on wired and wireless. I've run it with and without external SSDs. I've powered it down and left it unplugged overnight.

I posted the above here in the bleak hope that between all the celebrating and photos of consoles wearing seatbelts for their drive home - someone might have a clue how fix some issues with this glorified and overpriced mini fridge I've bought, and if not - how to contact the lovely guys and girls that fleeced me for £450 for it.

Wanting to take advantage of some of the new content on GamePass with the addition of EA games, I went to boot up Skate 3. I was met with the ""Getting your Xbox 360 info..."" page, a blank progress bar, and an endlessly spinning wheel. After about 5-10 minutes eventually the screen fades to black and the 360 game will load, but with no profile signed in. The game will prompt me to sign in, taking me to the 360 interface. I am told I need to ""Download your profile to use it on this console"". It then shows ""Checking network status"" with another spinning wheel steadily chugging along. After a while I will eventually receive a Can't Connect error: Can't connect to Xbox Live. Test your network connection, etc. But I am connected to xbox live. I cant function completely fine with all other connected aspects of the console, including a different 360 game from my library, one not associated with EA Play service, incase there was some conflicting authentication happening. Nope. Same issue when I attempt to play Banjo-Kazooie. 
I have scoured the limited amount of resources on this issue. Here is what I have tried:
Hard Reset Console
Hard Reset Network 
Removed saved game data 
Removed all 360 data
Erased and redownloaded games 
Removed xbox account and signed back in

"I think I figured out a potential cause of stick drift on elite series 2 So I bought an elite series 2 controller that came with slight drift with anything lower than .05 dead zones, so I returned it and got a new one with the exact same problem. I downloaded the game controller tester app on the xbox app and I set the dead zones to 0, and noticed that some days the drift on the app would be bigger and other days it wouldn’t. So I started playing around today In the app again, and noticed that your controllers position dictates the amount of drift. For example, if you place the controller more vertically (thumbs more towards you) the drift gets larger for when you aim down. If you place the controller back to neutral and place it in the other direction (thumbs away from you) the drift disappears when aiming down. Same thing can go with tilting it left and right. 

I think it has to do something with the fact that the joysticks are made of metal? You can also try on a game like cod modern warfare and set your dead zones to 0 and try the exact same tricks (moving your controller around)",xboxone,0

This so true customization and freedom of using a product. Steam allows the ability to customize to make things accessible for anyone.

"I need some advice Hello guys. I need advice in choosing my next console. I originally wanted a PC but its out of the picture now, as I wanna have 4k amd a reasonable amount of fps, and a pc like that is way out of my budget.

My options are PS5 and Xbox Series X. I am afraid that I will make a bad choice that will last for a long time. Right now I have an Xbox One S, and I like it. For next gen, currently I think PS5 is a better option because of the sound software, controller and the absolutely fantastic exclusives. However, for Xbox, I have a great controller, and a great headset. I also have game pass ultimate, which I use mostly on PC. My friends ar on PC and My current PC is powerful enough for the XB1/PS4 gen.

"50-63% Off Game Pass Ultimate Codes Today! Just went to Wal-Mart today and saw that they were selling 3-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription cards for the standard price of $44.99, but when I got to the checkout they only charged me $22.50, aka - 50% off! I ended up buying 6 (1.5 years worth). This 50% off price seems to be what they are charging online as well.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home I went to redeem my codes. Type the first one in and the website said that I had recurring billing for Game Pass turned OFF for my account and offered me an extra month if I turned it ON. I said, ""Sure."", clicked ""Ok"" and got my free month. That's when I had my brilliant idea: what if I go back in to my account and turn recurring billing back OFF and type in the next code? So I do that, and low and behold it asked if I wanted to turn it back on for an extra 1 month free. Abso-freaking-lutely! I've got 6 cards to turn in, which means I get 6 total months extra for free every time I do this. (See Warnings section below for a slight caveat)

&amp;#x200B;

So, easy step-by-step time:

1. Log in to [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com)
2. Click ""Services and Subscriptions""
3. Find Game Pass Ultimate, look at your expiration date line, and then click ""Manage"" &gt; ""Turn off Recurring Billing"" &gt; Confirm that you want to turn it off  (If you do not have Game Pass yet, skip this step)
4. Buy your GP-U cards from Wal-mart
5. Once you have your codes, log in to [redeem.microsoft.com](https://redeem.microsoft.com)
6. Type in your first code and go through the confirmation screens
7. Accept your free month by allowing recurring billing to be turned on
8. Wait for your confirmation email from Microsoft saying that recurring billing has been turned on
9. Repeat Step 2 &amp; 3
10. Wait 10-15 minutes for everything to process on Microsoft's end
11. Repeat Steps 5-10
12. Profit

&amp;#x200B;

***Warnings!!!***

Microsoft only allows you to bank up to 36 months of GP-U, so do not purchase too much that you go over! If you do, the extra will simply vanish

 Also, for some reason it only gave me the option to get the free month every OTHER code entry. Not sure why, but if you figure out how to get it to happen every time, you can get the full 63% off.

And even if it doesn't work, you still get you GP-U codes for 50% off, so it's still a fantastic deal.",xboxone,0

"XBL Gold to Game Pass Ultimate conversions on one account MULTIPLE times? Hoping someone has gone through this same process before and can help answer my concerns before throwing down 150ish dollars on XBLG codes for conversion.

I know how the process works, because I've already done it once before. In May of this year, I converted the remaining Live time I had on my account to GPU. That subscription has now lapsed completely, and my account is NOT active with GPU or even vanilla XBLG.

My understanding is that people whose accounts have PREVIOUSLY been GPU enabled, but no longer are, can in fact still use a Re-Subscription month to GPU for 15 dollars to convert any XBLG time. They simply aren't able to do it for the even cheaper $1 rate, because they've already used that. This appears to bode well for my plan. But.

My specific concern is this: I know my account is currently inactive, so that's not a problem. BUT, one question I haven't ever seen anyone address is if an account can utilize the XBLG to GPU process (through legit means, no VPNs or anything like that) two entirely separate times?

Or, since I already used the conversion promo earlier this year, am I precluded from doing it a second time, even though my account is otherwise seemingly eligible?",xboxone,0

"Advice Needed: Wheel for Racing Game Apologies if this question is ignorant, but I’m not really a gamer looking to buy a Christmas gift for my gaming husband. 

I know my husband would really like the Xbox Series X for Christmas (he currently has the Xbox One X), but I’ve been trying to get one at every release and just haven’t had any luck. I can get it in my cart, but by the time I checkout they are out of stock. Therefore, I’m still looking to get my husband something he will like and have as a Christmas present, since it’s looking like I won’t be able to get my hands on a new console in time. 

My husband plays a lot of different games, but consistently goes back to racing games. He likes the Forza game, but really prefers the F1 game. He has mentioned a few times that he would like a racing wheel for when he plays those games, but has never actually pulled the trigger on buying one, so I was hoping to surprise him with one. 

I’ve done some research and found the Logitech G920 Dual Motor one. It looks like it comes with the wheel and pedals, and has good reviews, but was hoping someone with more experience could help me, as it’s on the more expensive side, and I don’t want to spend that money on a product that will not be ideal for the gaming he does.

- Does anyone have that wheel? Do you like it / recommend it? 
- Will this wheel work for both forza and the F1 game? 
- Will this wheel still be good in the future when my husband does get the Xbox Series X? 
- am I totally off base and should be looking at another wheel? 

Thank you so much for all of your help and advice! I’d really like to be able to surprise my husband with something he will really like, but unfortunately where games and electronics are concerned I haven’t been able to in the past because I am not as knowledgeable on the best products.",xboxone,0

"If you're currently in the market for a good space sim, Elite Dangerous is currently on sale on the Xbox Store for only $8.99! Now that the Horizons expansion is included in the base game, that is an amazing deal!! And with the Odyssey expansion coming in early 2021, now is the best time to join in! \[I posted this over on the r/XboxSeriesX sub as well, but I figured I'd share it here too\]

Elite Dangerous is a space simulator set in the future around the year 3306. In the game you're basically given a small ship called a Sidewinder, you start off docked inside a space station, and it's up to you to make a living in the galaxy in any way you see fit. You can do bounty hunting against NPCs and players, you can become a space miner and head into asteroid belts to mine rocks, you can even explore our entire galaxy on a 1:1 ratio in it's entirety. You can literally leave our system (SOL) and fly all the way to the center of our galaxy to the core at Sagittarius A which is a giant black hole. Some people also find fun in becoming a space trucker, hauling goods to and from stations. Through making money, you can buy bigger better ships through you adventures and bigger better parts.

Here's a trailer for the game: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YESNObZJTgQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YESNObZJTgQ)T

he Horizons expansion is now apart of the base game of Elite, and with Horizons, you'll be able to land on planets, cruise around on them in your SRV, and have access to engineers on planets who offer drastic improvements on your ships! Engineers can make your ships reach their full potential ranging all the way from max jump range, how hard your weapons hit, how fast they hit, how light your ships are, how affective your shields and hull are. And it's why I've been saying for years that without Horizons, you weren't really getting the full Elite Dangerous experience. Now that it's apart of the base game, you'll only have to spend $8.99 on this sale to have all that!

Here's a trailer for Horizons: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKWIJ-H-WxI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKWIJ-H-WxI)

Now coming in 2021, we have an expansion called Odyssey, which is set to bring us a whole new gameplay dynamic with being able to walk around on foot on planets, apparently engage in gun combat on planets, walk around space stations on foot, and land on atmospheric planets. This is apart of a paid expansion, and no official release is set, but they're saying early 2021.

Here's a trailer for Odyssey: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wu8oqlXUag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wu8oqlXUag)

And here's an in depth look at Odyssey: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpe7ULtkYbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpe7ULtkYbU)

I also wanted to add, this game has some of the BEST player created groups I've ever seen in any video game before. We have a group, which I'm apart of called the Fuel Rats. Basically if anyone ever runs out of fuel in space, and you're stranded, you can call us on our IRC chat site, and request to be rescued, and someone will fly out to wherever you are in the game, and fill your ship up with fuel. It's amazing!

We have another group, which I'm also apart of lol, called Operation Ida, where we basically deliver cargo to space stations which have been effected by war in the area, and have been damaged and knocked offline. During these events, you can rescue civilians from the stations, but we deliver the cargo that's needed to repair these stations and get them back and running. Another awesome group!

There's so many player made groups like this in Elite that just makes the community feel alive, awesome, and welcoming! This game, for only $8.99 is a steal! If you're looking for a good space sim, THIS is the game you want. Without a doubt. If you do end up buying it, or maybe you're more curious before you do, come head over to r/EliteDangerous and see what's up. Many people share their screenshots from in game there and everyone's sure eager to help new players!",xboxone,0

"Gamepass is truly a great way to test games Got my Series X after skipping the previous generation. Now with kids I do not have time to dedicate to one game for 50-60hrs (and let's be honest - most games that long could benefit from some content trim, but developers are in the 'value for money' mindset), but I still enjoy a few games here and there. In the last two days Gamepass helped me to decide on a few games:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Yakuza 0 - wanted to buy it a few times for the PS4, never managed to. Started it and played for 3 hours, and although I appreciate the mature theme and adult cast in my jRPG I found the game play and fights too clunky for my taste. I would probably check out Like a Dragon sometime next year since I think turn-based system suits the series better.
2. Wasteland 3 - coming from Gears Tactics this is junk-territory. Not only is the first fight / tutorial unintuitive with little explanations the graphics, animations, etc. are definitely AA-tier.
3. Gears Tactics - was looking forward to it before buying the Series X and the game didn't disappoint. So far I'm getting my turn-based fix.",xboxone,0

"Questions about external storage for games + downloaded Youtube videos &amp; digital movies on Xbox Series X Been looking into which ones to purchase with Amazon Black Friday deals. Two part question so I’ll try to keep it simple.

I had originally chosen this Seagate 5tb in link below, to store both games, downloaded YouTube videos, and digital media. 
- Seagate Portable 5TB External Hard Drive HDD – USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PS4, &amp; Xbox - 1-Year Rescue Servie (STGX5000400) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VS8QCXC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabt1_dlC_HRrWFbD7X0MHP?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1

Then I realized maybe it’s best to separate them into two external devices as I learn videos, movies, shows etc. will fill space *fast*. Especially downloaded YouTube videos. So then I wonder if it’s better to go, let’s say, 4TB for games, and 3TB for media. Ideally, whichever two external storages I get total &lt;$150 roughly, so give or take 1TB wherever. I’d also prefer whichever type adds the additional “benefits” to storing games (speed etc). 

1) Which two devices would you recommend? 

2) Is there a console app that allows downloading YouTube videos to the external storage? Regular YT app doesn’t allow it.

"Why am I dissapointed that I got a Series X as a PC replacement knowing it’s not a PC and it can’t do PC things? First I want to count my blessings that I was even able to get a Series X for launch off the Microsoft store on the first day of preorders and yes it an amazing piece of tech but I keep stumbling back to my concerns from when I first got an xbox one that I later sold: What’s its purpose?

My plan going into next gen was obviously grab Sony’s and Nintendo’s consoles because they have their exclusives but Microsoft’s much more nebulous in the sense that when they do start pumping out games from their new studios, they’ll be on PC and Xbox. Since I have a PC that’s going on a decade old, spending $500 for a Series X as an upgrade seemed much more economical than what would ultimately be a rebuild for my PC.

So I got my Series X since it was the “easiest” to get ahold of versus the PS5 and loaded up on three years of GPU and I was all set with more games than I know what to do with. Problem is, when you leave a platform for an entire generation, things seem a bit lonely when your friends list consists of high school friends you don’t interact and all the friends you do play with are on PC. After an initial logical struggle of this dilemma, I realized the PC can still exist as a tool for when I need big computing power and any PC exclusive stuff wouldn’t be too taxing and I could cross play the rest with them. I, however, put wayyyy too much faith in the developers being that friendly and it all came to a head when my friends wanted to play Borderlands 3.

We were all grabbing it while it’s on sale now because we saw that it had cross platform play only to find out after I bought it on xbox that it was talking about cross platform between Steam and Epic and console cross play isn’t slated until 2021. Disappointed and one return later, I grabbed it on Steam and resigning to throwing everything on lowest settings so I don’t have to worry about performance but it didn’t help at all. My first mistake was only being able to install it onto the HDD on my computer so load times are lengthy with a comically long one at start but it stuttered and lagged everywhere.

Borderlands may not be the best scenario for performance stability but it was something that almost made me contemplate my own mortality. My PC is very clearly reaching the end of its gaming abilities now that the new generation is here and it’s really pulling on my sense of perfection and having the best form of everything. The Series X may be an excellent upgrade in several regards but it means almost nothing when you have the pressure of PC Gaming always saying they can do it more and better and, more importantly, what little friends i do play with are all on that platform. This chase for the upper edge is only going to get worse when I get a PS5 where it’ll then be a consideration for how the Dualsense amps up the playing experience (ffs though Microsoft, couldn’t have even added gyro to these new controllers? That’s like an industry standard now). All of this worrying is just making me think I’m too much of an enthusiast to settle with what an xbox can offer but keeps myself to its ability levels out of very reasonable financial and tinkering concerns when I just want to play a game and know that it’ll play well with the only settings being to throw on subtitles and calibrate HDR which oddly doesn’t read from the universal system calibration.",xboxone,0

I’ve been looking into some monitors on my own but everything I’m seeing either has 4K but only 60Hz, or it has 144Hz but not 4K, or it has both and it’s like $1500 or something.

I really need your help! I'm playing cod on a xbox one x and like real tryhard,  I sometimes record clips during my game. When I hit the 'record last 60 seconds' button and later go check the clip, it just recorded maybe 9 seconds instead of 60. 

Is there any solution for this problem?

"Xbox One Bluetooth Connectivity Issue making my game unplayable I have searched almost the entire internet in search of the answer to a game-breaking problem that literally only I apparently have regarding the new Xbox Series X/Xbox One controller. The issue I am having is that during any screen that appears to be rendering or loading anything, my brand new controller I bought (as the old one broke) will repeatedly disconnect to the point where the game is unplayable simply because the “controller disconnected” prompt will not cease To stop appearing till the rendering/loading sequence is over. 

This problem is especially bad in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, as any loading scene or cut scene is unwatchable and impossible to skip due to the controller continuously disconnecting.

For context I've owned the Turtle beach XO ones for a few years now (maybe 5?) and they're great although I broke the headband and the foam is starting to go and I think it's time to upgrade.  


I bought the Astro A40's about a year ago or less and had them for about 2 days before returning them as the sound quality was great but the spatial sound was atrocious no matter how many different settings I changed.

"Should I buy a better console for Cyberpunk, or keep my standard XB1? Hi all. I recently preordered Cyberpunk 2077, and was looking for quite some time at buying a Series X or S, but to no avail as they sold out faster than ever. I’m now at a dilemma where i’m contemplating on what to do about my console situation for this game, as I want the best performance possible when it launches (obviously won’t happen, but still).

I have stuck with my standard XB1 for some time now, and it’s basically Ol’ Reliable. It’s worked perfectly for many years now, and I’ve always done deep cleans on it to make sure it stays that way. Now, I never really needed any reason to purchase a newer console even when I had concerns of RDR2, because it just ran fine for me. For Cyberpunk, I’m quite concerned. I don’t know how well it would run on a standard XB1, and I’m puzzled on whether or not to buy an XB1X for performance concerns. Part of me says it’ll be fine and just continue to clean the console, but another part says that it could be pretty bad. So, I’m coming to all of you.

What do you guys think? Should I buy an XB1X, or stick with my standard for Cyberpunk? Thanks all!",xboxone,0

"Microsoft not having ANY real launch games for the new generation was such a hard fail I cannot believe microsoft released a new console without essentially ANY real killer software to showcase the new platform. It seems like such a misfire, a critical mistake to drop a new system with nothing to really entice buyers to get it. Now I know that microsoft is playing a long game right now, and that's superb for what they have in store.... but it's just a console release without any real meat on the bone. Meanwhile playstation has Spidreman AND a miyazaki game (Demon Souls)... we are left high an dry until the future promises are delivered. There is basically no reason to buy a series X except for faster loading and more FPS / Res. My one x is pulling hard and clean for now, and I certainly plan on getting a SX at some point.

Don't get me wrong, I'm team green all the way but love what all platforms bring to the table and play everything. It just seems like a really hard fail for the release of a new console that just kind of landed with a bit of a missed opportunity and a lot to be desired. what do you all think? In the end I am still super happy with what XBOX is doing, the studio acquisitions as of recent (bethesda whoo), and their attitude or philosophy towards gaming. I just hope they learn from this on the next iteration of xbox 5 years from now, and have some really killer software that just lights up gamers with excitement and drive hype through the wall. To me that's always what it's been about, is the excitement surrounding the culture and the communities with incredible software / hardware / tech that just breaks the previous generation's limits and possibilities. That was sorely missing from this generation on this side imo.",xboxone,0

I'm not really that concerned about the refund (The purchase was only $14.56CAD), I'm more concerned about the overly aggressive response from the agent.

Choppy, robotic, frequent kicks out, and when we try to come back in after getting kicked, it’s eternally “connecting”. The kicker is that we’ve tried all of the usual fixes.. resetting modem and router, restarting boxes, changing audio settings around. Party chat on the PS4 is butter smooth and it’s frustrating. We always end up having to switch over because of it. Anybody have this issue, or know if anything else we could try? Does the Xbox just hate our network?

"Push Scalpers Out Of Gaming As scalpers begin taking over the launch of new consoles and accessories we see an eerie similarity to the sneaker industry. However, unlike the sneaker industry, gaming is not necessarily a collector's market and we as a collective group can put pressure on the gaming industries to create ways to solve this problem.

I don't expect to get a next-gen console at retail price until year 2021 and I am fine with that if it means driving away these scalping industries. The difference between the sneaker industry and the gaming industry is that these game developers are making their games for the next-gen consoles and considering these consoles are not getting into the hands of actual gamers then the developers will eventually start running into problems selling product or be forced to continue developing for last-gen consoles. Hopefully game developers will put pressure on console makers by removing their exclusivity in order to sell more copies of their games unless more is done to get consoles into the hands of actual gamers.

It makes no difference to the Walmarts and Best Buys of the world who actually buys the consoles because they just see a unit being sold and are not reliant upon these sales. This is why we must put the pressure further up the chain to make a change.

These scalpers are relying on the fact that people will pay whatever it takes to get a console for the holidays. Please make a stand in solidarity to not purchase next-gen consoles or accessories from 3rd party sellers for inflated prices even if it means not getting a new console this holiday season. Otherwise, these scalpers will begin trying to take advantage of our industry and running it into the ground.

So it will sync to the system if I have the controller right in front or the xbox pointing it at it.

I am seeing slightly better load times, as shown in my results below. I understand that the drive is likely to perform significantly better on the Series X, as it could be limited by a number of things on the One X. 

My confusion stems from peoples reports saying that an SSD helped with the One X dramatically. Some people say formatting the drive in Windows first helped with this. Anyone care to share their experiences with External SSDs and the One X?

"How good is Gamepass? A quantitative analysis of 382 Gamepass games *TL:DR for people in a rush*

* After deduplication\*, there are a total of **382 unique Game Pass games**, out of which **43 can only be played on PC**;
* The **average Metacritic score** of all GP games (PC+Console) is **77.9**. The **median Metacritic score** of all GP games is **79**;
* **44.5% of all Gamepass games** (170/382) **are 80+ Metacritic** (which will be my criteria for “good” here). 17.5% of all Gamepass games (67/382) are 85+ Metacritic;
* **38% of GP games are indies**\*\*. Indies actually weigh down the total MC score (Indies MC=76.27, non-Indies MC=78.79). There are 47 “good” Indies and 123 “good” non-Indies on Gamepass (PC+Xbox);
* **Xbox GP is currently better value than PC GP** if you have to choose, since it gives you more “good” games (148 versus 86) worth more money if you were to buy them\*\*\* (€2,589 vs €2,046). This will change next month as EA Play PC gets added;
* If you have Xbox GP, **getting a PC brings you 22 additional “good” games** (+14.8%) that you wouldn’t be able to play otherwise (this does not take into account games that are better on PC);
* **75.1% of GP Games are from the Xbox One Generation**, the rest split between 360, OG and PC;
* Adding **EA Play games actually increased the overall offer’s Metascore** since EA Play games have an average MC of 78.38.
* **It would cost you €3,203.84 to buy all 80+ games** of GamePass today, taking into account the current Black Friday sale. That’s the equivalent of over 20 years of Gamepass Ultimate subscription. It would cost you €1,329.76 to buy all 85+ games (over 8 years of GPU).

&amp;#x200B;

**Detailed Analysis**

So I noticed there was no recent data on Gamepass and decided to create my own. I started by deduplicating the games from the main lists and pulled out the MC score and price for each of the games. I hope this will be useful for people on the fence.

&amp;#x200B;

**How good are those games?**

https://preview.redd.it/prqgxh9jwj161.jpg?width=681&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57d18726cd8ca999af74bb8ca39e37a300b29e8c

 Metacritic distribution shows a few trends:

* **Most games are in the “green” MC zone**, and slightly less than half of games are over 80 MC (170/382 or 44.5%);
* **27% of GP games are in the yellow or below zone**. Note that this includes games that launched weak but became popular later, like Sea of Thieves (69), Rainbow Six Siege (74) or Ark (69). The rest is junk;
* Less than 10% of games are not rated, either because they are early access or are indies which did not get reviewed enough times to get an MC score;
* There are **20 90+ games** in the list, out of which 11 are XBO generation, 7 are 360 generation and the rest is PC (2).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dckpbaaoxj161.jpg?width=683&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7618220bc4fedbdb0a8ac93d669ce734a74920b

Another view, this time showing the stats per main platform (games available on both are considered XB). PC has a better ratio of 80+ but a lower ratio of 85+ and 90+. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How are those games split by platform?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3vtcf6tsyj161.jpg?width=577&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ebe551e5123a6a9405fca66ce550a359ef47356

**XBO is by far the leading platform for GP games (75%)**, which imo is a shame as there are many OG and 360 games that were part of the BC program and are missing from the platform. It seems Microsoft was afraid of the service being seen as focusing on old games.

After XBO, the second largest contributor is the **360 generation (13.1%) followed by PC (11.3%)** and OG Xbox (0.5%).

EA Play contributes **60% of all Xbox 360 games** on the service (27/45)!

&amp;#x200B;

**How much do indies matter in Gamepass?**

Indies represent **38% of Gamepass games**, so liking indies is a big factor in how much you will enjoy it. Indies weigh the MC score down (average 76.3, median 77) compared to non-indie games (average 78.8, median 80). **Indies are only 27.6% of the “good” games** however.

Indies are also over-represented in the PC-only part of Gamepass, where they account for almost half of the games.

In my opinion, this ratio is going to either be maintained or increase as it is a lot cheaper to add indies to the catalog compared to AA or AAA games.

&amp;#x200B;

**How much does first party matter in Gamepass?**

Now this is where it gets *really* complicated when it comes to Microsoft, as their 1st party landscape is changing all the time. I decided not to make retroactively first party the games from studios that MS bought *after* they were out (so no Doom Eternal, Dishonored 2 but The Outer Worlds is in). Remember that when talking about MS, **first party does not mean exclusive or even console exclusive.**

Based on the calculation I used, **there are 53 first party games currently on Gamepass (13.9% of total games) with an average MC score of 79.5 and median MC score of 81**.

So the short answer is: not very much, although it contributes overall better games than the average of Gamepass.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the synergy between PC and Xbox Gamepass?**

There are **177 games that you can play on Xbox but not on PC**, out of which 83 are good (47%). There are **43 games that you can play on PC but not on Xbox**, out of which 22 are good (51%). So it makes more sense to also use an Xbox if you are on PC than the other way around at the time being.

The main PC exclusive games are MS first party PC games (Age of Empires, Flight Simulator, Rise of Nations), Paradox games (Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron, etc) and Amplitude/SEGA games (Endless series, Football Manager) so there’s a bias for strategy and sim games. Whether it’s worth it depends on your affinity for that genre as the rest is mostly indie games.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a summary of the stats for each of those subcategory (a game can be part of multiple subcategories):

[Average MC for subcategories](https://preview.redd.it/7c5k0slrxj161.jpg?width=594&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12de3e414db58b3f2a42a809bd05f5db345d18a6)

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional notes**

*There may be a few mistakes here and there since the data was collected with a mix of scripts and manual work, but those shouldn't impact the overall scores too much considering the size of the set. Also you may not agree with my classification.*

 \*Methodology for deduplication:

* Games that exist on both Xbox and PC are using the Xbox version for Metacritic score and price and are not counted as two different games. This choice comes from the fact that people are more likely to be Console GP primarily;
* Games that are part of another game (for example Halo CE as part of Halo MCC) are not counted separately.
* Games that are duplicates or components of another game (Gears 5 vs Gears 5 Ultimate, Walking Dead series individual chapters) are not counted separately.
* Games that have yearly releases (FIFA, NHL etc) are NOT deduplicated, so they are counted as separate games. This is because in my opinion they cannot be considered as clones from each other (some may disagree though).
* Deduplicated that way, you reach a total of 382 games.
* Games that will leave at the end of this month are not removed.

Methodology for Metascore

* Xbox Score if available, else PC Score, else PS4 Score, else Switch or other device Score.

\*\*Regarding indies, the criteria for Indies has become blurry as not many games are independently published anymore. I tried to stick with the main criteria of “not developed by a large developer” and “sold for less than €30” but even so you may not agree with some of my classification.",xboxone,0

"Anyone know how to dispute a denied refund? Hi all, hoping for a bit of advice here. Bit of a long one so 

TL;DR: Game barely runs, trying to get a refund on grounds of ""it doesn't work"", hitting brick walls with Customer Support. Where do I go next?

Pre-Ordered Gears Tactics digitally before it launched, played a few hours of the game on release and then it's started either crashing at launch, or freezing mid mission/at a loading screen maybe 40% of the time I try to play it.

Tried updates, re-installed, the lot. No good. Lost heart with it and I figure ""the game barely runs, surely this is grounds for a refund, right?"". So I filled out the form, said it crashes or just flat out won't launch. Got an email reply:

""Refund Denied: Refund window expired""

""Yes but the game barely works""

""Refund Denied: Game has been used""

""Yes it's been used, that's how I found out it crashes all the time""

""Your case has been closed. Thank you for contacting microsoft support""

Also tried phoning three times, Customer Service seem really helpful, put me on hold to see what they can do and then I just get cut off.

"XSX stock in UK My Xbox is getting delivered tomorrow so I can now divulge what I have learned in hopes it helps someone else. 

I have checked many websites and called around a lot looking for an XSX and was told the following:

- Game has pre-orders for XSS for the moment to be delivered before Christmas
- John Lewis were expecting an in-store shipment on Monday 30th, the agent wasn't sure about the website. My local store is now closed for Covid reasons so suspect that stock may be redirected to the website. A note about the website, the XSX (not XSS) always appears available around 1100 each day but you can never add it to your basket. I suspect this is when the website is updated because it's happened every day for the last fortnight so be weary if you are shopping on the website around then.
- my local Argos were expecting warehouse stock of the XSS second week in December
- Currys were not expecting any stock in store until January. I'm not sure if this means they won't have any on the website or not
- Smyth's were expecting stock first week of December
- box will have stock available on 7th and 14th of December, however you must enter a ballot for s chance to get one

"Elite 2 Controller Question Hi all, 

I've been looking to get the Elite Series 2 controller this Black Friday, are there any sites or stores in particular that usually have good deals? Usually the price ranges in between $220-230; I'm looking for anything under that. 

I should also mention that I live in Canada, so some US sites/stores wouldn't work haha.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",xboxone,0

A while back I had to take apart my Xbox One to clean it out as it was overheating really fast. After taking it apart, the power button stopped working which was inconvenient, but I worked around it by plugging my controller in via usb and clicking the Xbox button on the controller. 

This has worked for a little over a year but now, the usb option doesn’t work either. When I plug it into the controller and my console, my controller vibrates but my console doesn’t turn on whatsoever.

"How To Use Different Card For Past Due Subscription Hey everyone, so I just noticed my Game Pass Ultimate ran out a few days ago and I am flat broke until the 3rd, and I wanted to play Cold War. So my dilemma is that, I have a recurring subscription set up, however, the card I have it attached to is my debit card which as I mentioned earlier, I am broke and have no money in my bank. I have a parent who offered to use their debit card to pay for it and id just give them cash when I got it, however, this happened before, and I would get an error saying that ""this service isn't available right now, try again later"" basically going to pay the past due subscription, sitting on the spinning loading wheel for 10 minutes straight, before giving me an error and then continuing the spinning loading wheel until I press the B button to back out to the subscriptions options in settings. I was able to get help with Xbox Support on the official website but now it says ""telephone and live chats aren't available for this situation"" or something similar. 

Its not so much an issue of not having the money. It's moreso an issue of how I pay for it. Like i said, a family member offered to pay it for me using their debit card, but that's not the card that's attached to the past due recurring subscription.",xboxone,0

I have a few questions. Let me start with the xbox play and charge kit. First of all, will the xbox one play and charge kit work with the xbox series x controller? I know the charging cable won’t work, but could I use a PS5 charger? I’m not going to pay £20 for a different wire. Also, is there any difference between the xbox one play and charge kit and the xbox series x play and charge kit? Also another thing, because I have to use a different wire to charge the xbox series x, how would I know when the controller has fully charged? It would just say the controller is charging, but it won’t give an indication or a battery percentage. Also, it would be good if there was a light or some indication, like the xbox one play and charge kit. If people could answer my questions, that would really help me. Thank you",xboxone,0

"Retailers suffering loss due to scalpers Ok! I have read many arguments on how retailers and even Microsoft don't care who buy Xbox. Many people think that they only care about numbers sold and not who bought it. I think u guys are absolutely wrong. It's in best interest of all the retailers and Microsoft that xbox goes in the right hands. Everyone has budget. If they pay less on console, they will spend rest on games and accessories. If people are not buying console , or getting it from scalpers for higher price, they will have to adjust by not buying many games and accessories. It hits retailers directly and Microsoft will sell less games. 
I had a budget of $1000 and I bought console, extra controller and 2 games. 
If I decided to get a Xbox from a scalper, I would have bought just 1 game and would have bought the rest after few months.

"First Xbox Purchase Advice Hi everyone! 

With the pandemic, I have gotten really bored. I grew up with 3 older brothers who always had a console, so I never felt the need to invest in one. However, everyone is moved out and I’m interested in getting my own console (this will be the first time ever purchasing one). I honestly have no idea about anything in regards to owning an XBox and I’m not sure of which games I would enjoy. I know I will be purchasing GTAV since I grew up playing those games, but I’m not really interested in first person shooting games or anything that requires a lot of brains cells. If I could get Mario games for the XBox I would 😂.

So I was just posting to look for some advice when it comes to the Xbox One and wondering if anyone thinks it will go on sale for Black Friday or if I should just purchase it today. I am also looking for any game recommendations (I am an avid sims player if that helps). I really enjoy free roam games and fun party multiplayer style games (like Mario Party or Mario Kart). I’m not against more story telling games or zombie games or just more serious games but as a beginner gamer I want to ease my way in. Thanks for any help!",xboxone,0
"What types of games would you like to see for Games with Gold? Players frequently complain that Games With Gold an additional bonus of 4 free games a month at the cost of $10 a month for Xbox Gold is awful because:

A) They weren't planning on buying the games anyways

B) The Games with Gold are 'Old' and 'Always Discounted'

C) They already own the majority of Games with Gold

So what types of games would you the players like to see for Games with Gold?  Minor suggestion if Red Dead Redemption II or Cyberpunk 2077 is on that list, lower your expectations.

Some point to the PS+ Collection on PS5 which is described as a catalog of ""generation defining"" games including Batman: Arkham Knight, Battlefield 1, Bloodborne, Call of Duty: Black Ops III – Zombies Chronicles Edition, Crash Bandicoot N.

To me its a bunch of BC PS4 games that are old and always on discount. 11 of which are PS4 exclusives and in my opinion titles like Batman: Arkham Knight, Call of Duty: Black Ops III – Zombies Chronicles Edition, Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, Infamous Second Son, The Last of Us Remastered, Mortal Kombat X, Ratchet and Clank and Until Dawn weren't even good titles.

"Would my OG release Xbox One handle Cybrpunk 2077 I had this concern recently, mainly because of the rumours that the game’s last delay was because of the original console’s release models of what’s becoming past-gen. Also for the fact that no info nor gameplay  from these consoles have been released. Also I’ve owned my xbox for 6 years, so I know it’s on the later years of its life.

On the other side, I’ve played games like Red Dead Redemption 2 where you could suppose that because of top-notch graphics it would brick the console, but instead it ran quite decently and still didn’t lose much of the graphics’ details and quality. Also we are talking about CD Projekt Red, a game developer that has proven that their top priority is creating top-quality games. I mean, they even took a game as big like The Witcher 3 to the Nintendo Switch; that fact alone gives me hope they found a way so older console models can handle Cyberpunk 2077.

In the end, the main reason of concern is how dense the game’s areas could be; yes, my old xbox one could run Red Dead Redemption 2 nicely, but that game didn’t have at least 1 street full of skyscrapers around, and if I can point to an specific area it had its performance hiccups, they happened on the bigger towns like St. Denis. I’m not a guy who can’t play games if they don’t have the best graphics option or the smoothest performance, but I’m just hoping the game runs 30 fps mostly without significant drops and decent enough graphics. An newer console is quite far in savings for me, so if I determine myself to save for at least a Series S, it would take me probably until next year’s Christmas. So, what do you guys think, will the game run decently enough without bricking the console¿",xboxone,0

"Unable to get refund on Black Ops: Cold War (Digital) Hi,

I have attempted twice to receive a refund on this game after owning the game for just under a week. I am unable to actually have a live chat with a Customer Representative either on the web or over the phone. By the way, the Xbox Support site makes this entire process incredibly cryptic on purpose, so that they can avoid holding a live conversation with you at all costs (No listed phone numbers or live chat option). My seemingly only option is to fill out a request form and wait 2-3 business days for a response from a representative (no live chats or phone calls).

I feel I am entitled for a refund because the game runs horribly on my Xbox One S (frame drops and freeze framing every match make the game unplayable, and for god's sake just look at the opening ""press start"" cutscene on a One S, it is embarrassing), and I also don't enjoy this game as I have previous CoDs due to a draconian Skill-Based Matchmaking System. This is the first CoD I am requesting a refund on. I also was able to ask for a refund in a timely manner (just under a week), so Microsoft should continue their older refund policy.

It's bizarre that they would reject refunds such as this (I have definitely heard of people getting refunds before for similar reasons). If anyone has any better ideas on how I can get a refund, I'm all ears.

Thank you",xboxone,0

Heres how:

1)Buy up to 3 Years of Gold - you can buy them still at Best Buy for $60 retail

2)Redeem your Gold cards - remember, no more than 3 years but I would do all three if you can afford it.

3)Go [here](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/gold/upgrade) and it will upgrade your Good membership for $1 to Game Pass Ultimate.

Once you do this your subscription to Gold will show cancelled - this is normal because Game Pass Ultimate includes Gold.

If you have already signed up for Game Pass in the past you are ineligible.

I don’t NEED the complete console upgrade but a library expansion would be very nice. (Tired of re-downloading the same games). 

My only problem is.. I have no idea which one to buy! 

What is the best hard drive you can recommend? I’m looking to spend around $100-150. And with Black Friday coming up, I’m definitely taking advantage. 

I’m a newbie when it comes to hard drives, so I really don’t know which brands to avoid or which ones to look into. So I would greatly appreciate any input! Cheers! :)",xboxone,0

"So I posted this before and got no helpful reply, Is there a way to fix this stupid LFG glitch? For some odd reason I’m not allowed to make LFG (Looking For Group) posts, Microsoft help pretty much denies the problem or tells me I’m just going to have to deal with it but there has to be some way I can fix it.

*Solutions I’ve tried:*

- Power cycle (aka hard reset)
- Removing my profile and re downloading it
- Exiting LFG and retrying
- Double checking for inappropriate content. (including going through other posts and seeing what the most common tags are)
- Keeping my LFG short (minimal tags, minimal body text)
- Stretching my LFG (Hella tags, hella body text)

This will most likely end up as a repost in other Xbox or Microsoft related subreddits. Microsoft help and Xbox help websites have both told me my problem doesn’t exist or just ignore it which is why I’m here. 

Reminder; I’ve been crazy lonely which is why I’m trying so hard to post LFG, to find people to play with or talk to.",xboxone,0

"Would the series X and a sufficient TV make it look like PC gameplay? PC is always so crisp and smooth Just got a new apartment.  Have disposable income at a young age and no responsibilities.  

Want to treat myself on black friday to a new TV that has hdmi 2.1 and 120hz and a series X (if I can find one) to set up in the new pad.  

My question is, would it make next gen games, like BO Cold War run like they do on PC?

Every time I watch Twitch streams where they're playing on PC the games almost look entirely different.  The lighting is different,the textures are different, everything is so crisp and buttery and smooth. 

Would the Series X be able to mimic this?  What makes PC gameplay look so good?  Resolution, refresh rate, FPS????

I want to spoil myself and get something fairly future proof I can have for a couple years. Currently running on old 60hz 4k TV with xbox one x and yeah, it looks good.  I guess.  But still, when I see PC gameplay I'm left desiring more from the console",xboxone,0

"Anyone have experience getting their account stolen/getting it back? This weekend my Xbox Live/Microsoft account was hacked. I turned on my Xbox and it had me select my profile; weird I thought, but I selected my main account. All of a sudden it was asking me to put in my password and again I was thrown back a bit. Then it got really bad when I looked and it was asking for the password to an email I had never seen before.

At this point I attempted to contact customer support and quickly found that is near impossible, and actually impossible without an account. Since I couldn’t log in to mine I had to create a second account and try that way. Again I went through round after round with this dumb bot chat where it literally gives the same responses and when you get to the end you just restart with no help. Finally after choosing a problem I didn’t actually have, I was able to chat with a real person. Who, not quick enough, realized they couldn’t actually help me. So after going up the ladder twice more I was told they in fact couldn’t help me either but they could send me a form for some other department to determine if the account truly is mine.

So they emailed my second account this form which I had to fill out my information, stuff like IP address, console serial numbers, Gamertag, friends on my list, games I’ve recently played or purchased, etc.

My question is if anyone else has had to deal with this and has it gone well for you? I mean it seems like there’s no way they’d be able to keep the account from me but at this point I’m quite scared. I’ve done the automated account recovery thing twice now and the bot that assesses that has denied me both times. Now this other form has been much more detailed and I believe a human will review it but still. I have like 10+ years on this account with thousands spent, I’d really hate to lose all that...",xboxone,0

Back Story:
I am playing on a mobile Hot Spot - I have been for over a year now. I had no issues until about 2 months ago, and now no matter what I do I can NOT connect to a party. I can not Join a party. I can not create a party.

Things that I’ve tried: 
1: Hard reset of xbox. Unplug power, wait a minute, replug in. Holding down the xbox button. Unplugging and just turning on.

2: Custom DNS settings:: I found a reddit piece that suggested setting DNS to 8.8.8.8 and alt DNS to 8.8.4.4. I did this the other day, and it worked - for a day. I was able to join parties the day i switched it over. Since then nothing.

3: Clearing the alternate MAC address

4: Tried doing some alternate port selection on the xbox.

Because it’s a hotspot I am unaware of a way to assign a static IP address. My NAT is OPEN. My speeds are good. My box tells me all services are available.

"The Rage - A Trade In Story So, I was one of the lucky people to get a preorder for a Series X through Microsoft themselves and the console arrived pretty early on the day of release. This left me with an All Digital One S (I did have a One X but it died a death from overheating and I'd sold it before seeing how easy it was to fix) to trade in or keep for multiplayer with with wife. As we no longer live in an area with good enough web to do that (we tried) we traded in.

Due to all *waves hands around in all directions* this, we decided that rather than go down to our local CEX and possibly risk either catching or spreading the disease du jour, we'd take advantage of their mail in service. So we packed up our pristine, less than one year old Xbox and printed out a mail in label, then sent it off.

A nailbiting few days passed where it wasn't arriving and we were watching it sat in a warehouse, imagining couriers throwing the box around. Thankfully the email eventually came that it had been delivered in one piece. Sadly this was followed within the hour by another email from CEX (an aside, can you believe that's actually pronounced ""sex"", like officially) telling us that the Xbox couldn't be traded in because it wouldn't turn on. So they were sending it back.

I was furious. The courier had been tossing it about obviously, I thought. Or maybe we were going to be getting a broken one back from them while they sold the working one. If it was the former, then I was fine as the console was still within warranty and I could just get it fixed then sell the working one. But the latter? I had photos of the box and the serial numbers because it's common sense when trading in something, but the thought of going through the whole rigmarole was not something I was looking forward to.

This morning the box arrived back with us and we made sure to be recording a video while we opened it and checked the serial numbers. Same box back; great. Plug in the cable and plug that into the box, press the button, and it immediately turned on. What the hell? Had they bothered to test at all? Had they not pushed the power cord in fully, as it's a bit stiff on a box that new?

That's when I saw it. The controller had batteries in it that weren't there when I sent the box in, and they were in the wrong way around...",xboxone,0

"Need TV Options So my current TCL 55” Roku TV is showing it’s age and now that I have the Xbox Series X I feel like it’ll be a good time to upgrade. I’ve been lurking a lot on the Best Buy website and I’m actually quite tech. savvy but TVs aren’t my forte. I know in order to get the full TV experience you need a display with HDMI 2.1 and most TVs on the Best Buy website do share that information. However, where I’m getting tripped up on is the compatibility of the TVs with the Xbox.

As an example, I was eyeing a Vizio 55” OLED that is on sale but after reading the reviews it looks like 120Hz, even though the TV outputs it natively, isn’t supported with the XSX. I’ve also read other reviews on other units where the XSX makes the TV act wonky with HDR enabled. Other TVs say they’re HDMI 2.1 but seemingly aren’t. It’s a jumbled mess.

So I’m looking to see if anyone has any suggestions on a good TV to snag. I’d like to get all of the features the Xbox can provide out of the box if possible as I’d like to make this TV as future proof as possible since I’ll be looking to own it for 4-6 years.",xboxone,0

"PSA: Stop saying GamePass games are ""free"" Please, stop talking about GamePass games being ""free"" on GamePass.

None of them are free.  You are paying for a service to access everything on GamePass.  You aren't even getting EA Access for free: it's just now included with the subscription.

I really wish people would stop treating subscription models as ""getting things for free"".  It's particularly bad with gaming services, but I've even heard people say this about Netflix (sure someone might share their password, so it's free *for you*, but someone is paying for it).  In the case of the $1 Ultimate deals - sure, you can upgrade your remaining Gold time for $1, which *feels like* free, but you still had to pay for all that Gold time.

Why does this matter?  For many, it probably doesn't seem to matter much at all.  They know they are paying, it's just an attitude.  This attitude, though, can be harmful for some people, though — even if it's not their own attitude.  There are two types of people I can think of (but probably more).

One, which is a hedge case, is someone who enjoys single-player games, but due to budget constraints, are only now picking up an XB1 after they price dropped due to the XsX release.  They might be led to believe playing something on GamePass is won't incur any extra cost, when really, it's out of their budget.

**The other, far larger group, is children whose parents' pay for the subscriptions.  Getting kids to understand the value of money is hard enough.  When so many people around the gaming community treat GamePass games as ""free"", it makes it so much harder for their guardians and teachers to teach them this.**

Now, anyone have a ladder?  This is a pretty tall soapbox.",xboxone,0

"Question on Game Sharing Some friends of mine and I are discussing how our gamesharing works as we're a bit confused as to how we have access to games we shouldn't have...

We have three people A, B and C.

A's Home Console is C  
B's Home console is A  
C doesn't game share.

So how is it that A has a game C bought if he doesnt share with anyone?  
And C has a game B bought even though he only shares with A?

—

I suspect that since A's home console is C, any games bought on that console - even on Person C's account with their card - automatically go to A's account.

But I can't figure out the chain of sharing that's allowed a game B bought to go to C's console.

"Let's talk about the Xbox One's TV features. The bottom paragraph has some questions if you don't feel like reading the long-winded story at the beginning.

So I used to use my Xbox one as my center of my media center. I had my cable box plugged into the HDMI in . I bought an IR transmitter to control my TV volume and change the channels on my cable box. I bought the remote so that I could use all of it without booting up my controller. And everything was great. I loved it. it was so nice to just be able to say Xbox on and everything turned on. It voted directly into one guide and my whole media center was ready to go.

Then my Xbox One got stolen and my life kind of got crazy for a little bit so I went without an Xbox for a good long while. I recently got back into it with the Xbox One X. This time though, I just used it as a game console.

But now, I've got a series X so I've decided to use my One X as a media center controller again. And it's great. The Xbox One still has purpose, and the TV functions are so cool. I can understand why they thought this would be a good selling point, they just didn't sell it very well. But honestly, the Xbox one might go down is my favorite console ever because of this. I highly recommend anyone thinking of getting rid of their Xbox One to try all these functions before trading it in for the Series X.

This time around though, I'm going even further. I've got all the stuff that I mentioned above. The IR emitter, the remote, the HDMI in... But I've also got a digital TV tuner, a Kinect, and a Raspberry pi. That, and I dropped in a big 2 TB SSD so I've got a giant library of games that can be booted.

My IR emmiter cable, my raspberry pi, and my TV tuner is on its way. So here's where my questions come in. The Kinect has an IR blaster. How good is that blaster? Will it be able to control everything I need? Will I be able to plug my raspberry pi into my HDMI in and use my TV tuner at the same time? What will my one guide boot into? Right now I'm using a cable box that only picks up antenna signals so I figure I would just use the Xbox as a tuner.

Also, what else can I use this Kinect for? I've got one connect game but my girlfriend wants to use it for like fitness apps and stuff. You guys got any suggestions?

Once fully loaded, the Xbox One is a pretty damn cool piece of kit.",xboxone,0

"About Xbox and japanese titles. So I just saw that NEO The World Ends With You was announced, and to no surprise, is coming to PS4/Switch only. Yeah, I understand that Xbox has low reach on Japan, and those kind of games are mainly Japan focused, but MS supposedly is trying to change that. DQXI is a good start, but is still a game coming one year later than in other platforms, we have no news about FF7R release date (and also a year late), and FFXVI is releasing as a timed exclusive for Sony too. Sega is supposedly supporting MS - Yakuza 7 is ok, but we still have zero news about Yakuza 3-6 coming to Xbox and we have literally zero Atlus' rpgs on Xbox One - Series (Atlus belongs to Sega). We also lack a lot of good Namco titles like Tales of (we only have Vesperia), Digimon and God Eater. For payed exclusives like Final Fantasy - I can understand, but a LOT of other game developers simply decide not to port to Xbox.

Most of these games I can still play on my PC (and thank God they are on Steam), but it (my pc) is already kinda old and I'm not planning to upgrade (thats why im getting a Series), so with the time I will just lost access to future titles that decide not to come to Xbox.

"Deep Rock Galactic is way more fun than it has the right to. It went on gamepass about a week or two ago.  The big EA game dump might have over shadowed it, so if you missed it double check.

But seriouy this game is too dang fun.  

The premise is simple.  You are a Space Dwarf and you orbital drop into a mine, explore a cave and collect ores while shooting space spiders.

But the classes and how they work together, the timed evacuation, the bug swarms, the sheer variety of caves and mission types, and the humor all just works together to make it so dang addictive. 

If you can play it in a group I highly recommend it.  Solo isn't bad but the game is designed around the classes working together.

Never would have even looked at this one if it wasn't on gamepass, now its one of my favorites.",xboxone,0

"Destiny 2 looks really weird since this new DLC launched 2 weeks ago, but other 4K/UHD/HDR games look just fine. Tried calibration, can't see the ""closed eye"" in the brightness settings either [https://imgur.com/a/PQ6nQD5](https://imgur.com/a/PQ6nQD5)

I put some pictures together of how Destiny 2 looks compared to Red Dead 2 and Anthem. All were captured on my XB1X and are 4K/UHD/HDR. 

* The first 2 are Destiny 2. I can't see any definition on the character, named Xur. If you've played Destiny you'll know what he is supposed to look like. The second picture shows this red aura that is showing up in lots of shadowed and dark areas. This was not there before the DLC launched. But dark areas have always been terrible for me on Destiny 2 with my TV. There are times where I saw nothing but black when other people I was playing with saw details.
* The next 2 pictures are Red Dead 2. I chose these because they are especially dark and you can clearly see the shadows do not look weird, they do not have a blue tint to them, like Destiny's shadows have at some times now. It's like I turned one of those filters on for pics in my phone. 
* Last is Anthem. This picture has bright sunlight and deep shadow, which is why I chose it. Again, it looks 100% how it should. If that was Destiny, the shadowed areas would have that blue tint and the darkest spots would not be at all visible. 

As for the setting/calibration issues I'm having, I thought it might be my settings. First thing I did was disable all 4k and UHD settings and went in to 1080 Destiny to check my brightness was set to 4, middle. Then I went back and enabled all 4k and went into the calibration menus. First I did HDR for games. All those worked fine. For the one where it was all white, it did feel I had to press right quite a bit to get all the lines to disappear and the box be completely white. And also for the first one where you barely see the black &amp; gray checkers, I only had to press right a few times (from all the way left) to make it appear correctly. 

Now when I go into the Calibrate TV settings, I followed all the instructions and can't see the ""closed eye"" even if my brightness is set to 5, which is the maximum for my Samsung TV. Also, I could not figure out how to set the **XBOX HDMI black level**, which it said to match the TV, which is auto. But I can't find HDMI black level on the Xbox menu.",xboxone,0

"Xbox One X won't boot. I've had my Scorpio since day one. It's currently in a well ventilated area and has some minor dust build-up but nothing extreme. Last night, after playing for several hours, I was browsing the Store and the app kept crashing. I had just given up trying to get it to work when my Xbox crashed. I was annoyed but I booted it back up, and it crashed again after 5 seconds on the home screen.

I attempted everything I could think of; unplug and leave alone for a few minutes, boot up with out anything else plugged in, etc. Nothing worked. I left it unplugged all night and tried again today. Same issue.

I tried to get ahold of support but they were apparently overwhelmed today so I'll try again tomorrow.

This thing is my baby and I'm very upset because it has never been dropped and I feel like I keep it relatively clean. It's looking like my Advanced Warfare OG Xbox One is going to outlive Scorpio and that sucks.

"Xbox Series X sometimes turns itself back on when I turn it off The console is in Instant On mode. I turn it off by holding the guide button on the controller and selecting shut down. Sometimes it literally turns itself back on immediately after turning off; my TV remains on. When that happens my controller de-syncs from the console and cannot be synced back until I completely shut down the Xbox and remove power.

I have a sneaking suspicion this might happen because of buggy HDMI-CEC implementation on the Xbox. I activated it on the Xbox and on my TV and I have selected the first two options: ""Console turns on other devices"" (turns on the TV when I turn on the Xbox) and ""Console turns off other devices"" (turns off the TV when I turn off the Xbox). I have yet to run any comprehensive tests. Regardless it's really annoying and a pretty big bug to have been omitted...

Posting something a little different here today. From the title, I was trying to say how do you decide which game(s) to focus on and which to let slide for awhile? For example, my situation is that FPS and fighting games are my two favorite genres. For me, that means I have access to:

Halo MCC/5

Gears 4/5

Apex/Titanfall 2

MKX/11

Tekken 7

I'm probably leaving some out, but those are the main culprits. Each game is different and offers either a different perspective or gameplay style, but sometimes it feels like I struggle to choose which games to focus on. I was wondering if anyone else experiences this and how you've dealt with it?

"One week with Xbox, my first impressions!!! 
Well guys, I'm already one week days with the ""technical miracle"", here are my impressions:

-	The console does not heat up and makes no noise, but like, nothing at all. It’s impressive.
-	Microsoft’s proposal with the XSX is not to start a new generation, something new and unusual like the Nintendo Switch for example. The proposal is what I call “cell phone exchange”: you don’t buy a new cell phone to have new experiences, you buy it to do everything you already do, apps, photos, games, only better. And that is what the XSX is: everything you already know and played from the last three generations better;
-	And, like every new cell phone, this new Xbox will run everything, but some games will be much better, others not so much and some will be the same. For example, two games that I play for 5 years, every year, since they left:

Batman Arkham Knight: runs at 30 fps with 900p res, nor is 1080p HD standard. In Series X it continues to run in these settings but runs without braking due to the VRR (Variable refresh rate) and HDR, because the Xbox puts HDR in games that it doesn’t have (beautiful thing). The game got better, yes. Not as fuck. Similar to the PC version, nowhere near.

The Witcher 3: the game on Xbox One X (fucking names ...) it had two modes: 4k at 30 fps and between 1080p and 2k at almost 60 fps. In this second mode the resolution is dynamic, the game changes resolution to keep the framerate high, close to 60 fps. Only he has some sharp drops, to 40 fps, then back to 60 fps, the fluidity goes down the drain. On Series X, this mode runs at 4k and 60 fps. The game just got fucking better! Similar to a PC experience, a lot!


-	This console finally (and the PS5 most likely too) solved the three biggest problems of the last two generations: loading time, downloading speed and framerate. I remember that in 2013 when they launched the Xbox One and PS4, I thought to myself “we will finally play full HD (1080p) at 60 fps”. Hahahaha, sorry mistake. Neither in 90% of the games of this generation.

The previous generation, the PS360, was the one that introduced the digital store, digital games and with it endless downloads, starting to download the night, go to sleep and wake up the next day at the very end of the download. Not to mention that the store itself, most of the time, is locked, slow, the experience is not cool. It was also in this generation that the loading time got worse. Of course, there has always been this since the media left the cartridge for the CD, but they were much more acceptable on the PS2, GameCube and Xbox. Who remembers 10 minutes to load a chapter on PS3 Metal Gear Solid?

Everything from the past!
-	Loading time: average of 30 seconds to load a game, loading of 10 within the game at most. That when there is ...
-	Downloading speed: my connection is 400Mps. On PS4 low to a maximum of 90 Mps, on Switch it is no more than 40 Mps. In XSX? It has already reached a speed of 460 Mps, don’t ask me how…
-	Framerate: 60 fps smooth ‘made a baby’s bootie’ at 4k resolution. And there are some games with the option of 120 fps if the 4k are dynamic. Stupid. And there’s VRR to guarantee extra fluidity, absurd.

-	Okay, but is it worth selling a kidney to buy this shit? It depends. If you have a top-of-the-line 4K HDR 55 ”TV or higher and you want to play your games on it, yes, absolutely. Now if you play anywhere, on the screen on your phone, on the kitchen tube television, you don’t care about 4k and that HDR shit, so the answer is no, because you’re going to play the same games on your PS4 / XONE and not you will notice most of the aforementioned differences;
-	What about the PS5? The Xbox hasn’t had exclusives in a decade… Yes, it’s true. But there is GamePass and that alone is worth buying the black box. It is not by chance that 70% of buyers of XSX and XSS have subscribed to GamePass. And there is no reason not to do it: it is extremely cheap in relation to the more than 100 games, mostly trilpe A, that it offers. Ball inside Microsoft;
-	The only negative aspect of the device is the control. Not that it is bad, quite the contrary, but it is the same shit from the previous control that was already the same as the X360… Microsoft is looking like Sony that made the PS1, PS2 and PS3 with the same control! There was a microphone, a pad, a flasher missing, I don’t know!

In short, a long time ago I was not satisfied with a console as I was with this Xbox Series X. I think the last time was with the X360, that I bought a better TV just because of it. The rest with the other consoles was exciting and then hey, it could be better, but that’s okay.",xboxone,0

Day 10 or 11 while playing pub g a black horizontal line appears about 30% up the screen from the bottom I reset everything it went away started playing again and it appeared again I kept playing a bit and after awhile about 8 sets of 2 lines each running to the bottom appeared . I was pissed so I just put I a repair request with lg and went to sleep. Next day I looked it up online saw some similar but not exactly the same problems people had but none with the cx . I did all the trouble shooting things I could come up with and that I found online , nothing worked . I gave up and just went on using it for the day when i noticed that where my Xbox was the lines were white ( I put it where my old one was which standing up was pretty close to the tv about 6/8 inches away on the top shelf of the entertainment center) so i moved it down a level and just off set from the tv so it’s not under it and about 24hrs later i noticed the black part of the lines were gone , only the small section of white remaining ( about 3in ) I unplugged it and plugged it back in and they were gone.

Recent power outage may have killed my OG Xbox One The other night the power went out in my area. It blinked then a little bit later the power just went out and stayed out for a good few hours. I mean for like 4 or 5 hours in the early morning. I dont know why it went out but whatever did it must have killed my OG xbox one. It was on and working fine before because I had it running to download a game I just purchased. Power came back on and i have yet to get it to power on and play. I had been having trouble with the DVD drive not wanting to detect or read the discs once I changed games and inserted the new game disc. Most o f my games are on a External HDD because we only recently had a internet upgrade that put us closer to what most everyone else already had for years... Broadband internet. I was on DSL until recent when they opened a fiber optic line that just opened..... Anyways what can I try to get the xboxc going again if it can be repaired without cutting off a round private body part..... Ive tried every way I can think of. Hold controller button to turn console on does not work. Button does not work. I cant eject it to make it turn on for that.... Ive tried to hard restet the console and nothing. There was no water damage or anthying so maybe the surge of power through the line fried it? Any suggestions are appreciated,xboxone,0

"One heck of a dilemma Alright hello friends! 

I have to make a decision of choosing between the Xbox one at half the price of the xbox series X, the issue being I'm french, so there is some stuff i have to consider if i want to make a purchase. I have adhd and the governmental laws of my country has a system such as providing incomes for people like me who can't maintain, find or hold a steady a job routine on top of not having any professional qualifications anyway. About 900€ every month for just existing at this point so i cumulated over 3 to 4k of savings, but since the Xbox series X is sold out i have to look for resellers who are using the situation to sell their preorder on eBay a lot more expensively. The person in charge of filling up my paper work and transferring the received money on my bank account while making sure i won't spend it all which is helpful but so goddamn maddening since i gotta make compromises when asked to transfer more of what i saved up, those two things im speaking of; my monthly incomes and the restrictions of having to refer to someone to request more when not spending it are different but go hand in hand, im fortunate i don't have to face the real world workplace and i have someone doing the math for me, but so unlucky i've also gotta deal with this bullshit. I sent an email, she only allowed 500€ being the original price, i mentioned it was sold out anyway and i would have to buy it on ebay more expensively but she was unwilling to take the risk to transfer more for it so now, the question is:

&amp;#x200B;

Do i save up until my next money transfer while praying it's still gonna be sold on ebay for 700-800 when it comes down to it or just fly out compromise and choose the xbox one even if honestly the specs of the xbox series x are even more powerful than almost 3 times the price of a gaming PC (yeah i know, it's relative though). sorry im just a bit greedy i guess, but you gotta admit that console is beautiful to behold or give on Christmas eve if you have kids. :)",xboxone,0

Secondly, hypothetically if you were to have an OG system - should you run it on a 1080p monitor, or a 1440p monitor? As you can see that sort of intertwines with the first question.

"UK gamer here with £20/£25 to spend in the Black Friday sale and would like to hear your thoughts on my choices... I am quite poor and don't actually have an Xbox One yet. I'm not here to beg, just get some advice. I'm still on my old Falcon 360 (I too am surprised it is still going) but expect to get an X1S just after Xmas when the 2nd hand prices hopefully drop when people start selling their past gen tech. I've been doing Microsoft Rewards to set my self up so I have some digital games when I do get my console.

I have worked out that I can pick up The Ezio Collection (£7.99)(Though I have not played an AC game before have a AC1 and Rogue on 360 via GwG but not played them yet), Sleeping Dogs Definitive for £3.59, Saints Row 4 with Gat out of Hell for £4.79 (I loved SR3), and Rage for £3.59 and that's got me bang on £20. I'll likely have enough points at the end of the sale to pick up the Rare Replay for £4.99 too and I wondered what you think of my choices. 

As a racing games fan I am considering swapping out Rage for NFS: Rivals as that's only 10p over and if I get a nice agent they might be willing to gift that tiny amount of credit to me, save putting it on a card, though I might do that regardless

I'm not a big online player so the multiplayer aspects of games don't tempt me that much but I think that's due to me only having gold very rarely indeed right now, and only really getting it when the offerings on GwG are ones that tempted me. 

(I already have a few games doing things like this - Sunset Overdrive, Re:Core and Far Cry 3 in summer, Metro Redux Bundle when they gave away £5 in credit, plus a couple of give away wins like Tomb Raider and Witcher 3 GOTY elsewhere on Reddit, and FH3 from a friend. Fallout:NV does tempt me but I want to play 3 first, which I'm about to start)

"I created the easiest way to share and collaborate on links with fellow gamers! Hello r/xboxone!

After being frustrated with not being able to share and collaborate on links with fellow gamers, I created [SeeLink](https://seelink.app/), a platform to simplify sharing and collaborating on links with fellow gamers. 

Conventionally, sharing links with people was done through messaging apps, where they would get lost in the sea of messages. [SeeLink](https://seelink.app/) allows its users to create boards to share links with individuals / groups of people, allowing them to save and share human-readable links at the click of a button. 

After 3 months of work, I have created a complete platform that simplifies link sharing and collaboration, allowing you to seamlessly share, save, and collaborate on links with thousands of people. For example, you could share links to up and coming RPGs or games with fellow gamers.

An example of a SeeLink board is here: [https://www.seelink.app/raghav/RJ3XdgcgCD5JUXwBEyjtZN](https://www.seelink.app/raghav/RJ3XdgcgCD5JUXwBEyjtZN). Feel free to add more, it'll be highly appreciated!

Looking on Mouser I found this [thumb stick by Alps](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Alps-Alpine/RKJXV1224005?qs=%2Fha2pyFadug%252BYLGSsSjK%2FcCDayd%252ByGCK8dxv1W5cZTGJBdObFpXNzYeahuj%252BR3Qu).

I wanted to throw this out here so that others can find replacement parts if they choose to repair their controllers.

Settings options for future games Seeing a lot of comments and posts about how difficult it is to design Xbox games for 5 different consoles of varying performance. It seems like this is exactly what happens when designing games for PC though. Devs can’t expect to know the exact hardware a PC player will be using so allow PC players to dial up or down game features with a robust assortment of settings. Can this not also be a solution for Xbox games? Let Xbox Series X players max out settings while Xbox One players dial them down?,xboxone,0

"COD Cold War - Campaign Crashing - Xbox Series X Hi All, 

I have the Xbox Series X and was enjoying COD Cold War until I hit the Break on Through mission. When I get to the point where you choose a path to the right it freezes over and over again. Usually it goes to the home screen but often it completely restarts the Xbox. 

The disc was $70 for the correct Xbox Series X game. Does anyone have any recommendations for how to resolve this? If I uninstall the game and reinstall will I lose all of my campaign progress?

This is so frustrating to be unable to proceed in the game. Activision appears to have terrible customer service. I reported the issue online and they don't even ask for your contact info. When I call them it just says to refer to the online portal. This is a terrible experience, if they want to increase the price of games to $70 then it needs to actually be playable. 

Thanks for any guidance you can provide.

So all that being said I'd love some recommendations for my One X that aren't necessarily non M rated games, but ones that straddle that line of PG-13 type content, or even provide options to play in a more pacifistic way.

I like that the HS70 has Bluetooth, USBC Charging, and is fairly inexpensive, but it is wired and does not have a chat/game mixer. The 7x is wireless and has a chat/game mixer, but you lose Bluetooth, uses a dongle, and it's micro USB charging... The 9X has everything except USBC charging, but is twice the price of the HS70.

"Some new and interesting features of Cyberpunk 2077 revealed [Article](https://nintendosmash.com/improved-car-physics-and-other-joys-of-life-16-hours-of-experience-in-cyberpunk-2077/)

Here is a review after 16 hours of gameplay. Fairly long and lengthy. Driving and melee have been improved.

 

Reading it with Randy Savage ""Oooh yeahh""

*Cyberpunk has a nice shooting experience: the recoil, sound, animations, and reactions of opponents create the feeling that V has a real weapon of death in his hands. This time I was able to try a lot of different pistols, machine guns, rifles, and shotguns. And I can say that the first impression was not wrong-shooting in Cyberpunk 2077 is not inferior to shooters in terms of development.*

*One of the most interesting features of the battle in Cyberpunk 2077 is that enemy netrunners can also hack the main character. In such situations, your character will have a scale that shows how soon the hacking process will be completed. If the hacker is not neutralized in time, the enemy “demon” will cause damage to the V.*

*For example, I was repeatedly loaded with a “demon” that overheats the system — because of this, the hero starts to burn. Another “demon” called “Vasyan” just causes a lot of damage to the VI — it is important to guess the moment when the attack will be made in order to have time to use the first-aid kit.*

*Netrunners are not just another type of enemy with different armor or weapons. If you entered the battle and revealed your location, they will definitely find you and strike: hackers can see and hack the hero even through cameras or their allies. Netrunners work at a distance, so you can’t just hide behind boxes.*

*In skirmishes with hackers, it is impossible to dig in at an advantageous position and calmly shoot back — they force you to rush into battle and constantly move forward.*",xboxone,0

now it installs to both the internal and external

now you have 2 copy's of the same game. lol

&amp;#x200B;

The more hard-drives you connect the more you will see odd behavior like this.

I think the issue is more prevalent if you have more than one external hard-drive.

&amp;#x200B;

I just recreated an example here

Fallout 76 is stored on my 4tb hard drive (had it from free play days)

Today I buy the game on discount (stupid me)

Without checking it just re-downloaded the hole game on my 8tb hard-drive and ignored my 4tb hard-drive.

Keep in mind both hard drives are connected to the Xbox series x all the time.

what ever code they wrote to check if game is all-ready on one of the hard-drives is clearly broken.

people with slow net need to keep an eye on this problem as it will waste serious internet bandwidth as well as hard drive space with multi-able copy's of the same game.",xboxone,0

this is my first Xbox, so I don't know much about it.

I have a question regarding GPU games and the Xbox store in general.

I currently have an american Microsoft account because I like to play my games in the original language and uncensored, but my account keeps getting locked because of that. I am subscribed to GPU for 3 years already.

I read online that you can just switch your Xbox system region to US to get the american version of games.

Now my question is: can I switch my account region to my actual region, leave the system in US and still download and play the Game Pass and EA Play games from the US store, or can you only download Game Pass games from the region your Microsoft account itself is set in?",xboxone,0

I turned it back on and it immediately resumed the update only to crash again at the same point.

I have attempted an offline update and a reset through the troubleshooting menu on the advice of the Microsoft online chat. Neither of these things have fixed the problem as it just reverts back to the update and crashes at the same point. I believe the factory reset was successful but it still insists on finishing the update before I can set it up again.

"Elite Series 2 controller-personal findings Apologies for:

Formatting- on mobile
Repost/previously discussed issue

I wanted to post this to see if anyone has played around with various settings or ways to connect the elite series 2 controller to a PC. 

I am currently on controller #2. My first controller purchased from Best Buy had the issue with the A button not responding every time I pressed it. As I was trying to get the A button to respond, I noticed that it seemed to respond more often after a different input on the controller. For example, repeated A presses would fail to register, but and A press, followed by movement on the joystick, then another A press seemed to work fine. I made sure all my drivers and software was up to date, restarted/re-synced my controller to my PC, but with no success. I exchanged it for a new one today

When I connected my controller to the PC via Bluetooth today, immediately I had the same issue. Repeated A presses would fail to register in-game, no matter how fast or slow I pushed the button. Where I pushed or the pressure applied seemed to make little difference. I was also able to replicate the A button, Joystick movement, A button pattern results. 

Then I tried to connect the controller to my PC with the included USB cable. Immediately, all of the A button issues disappeared. Repeated A presses, A presses in combination with other input, all of it worked. 

I know that various disappointed customers have posted about similar issues in various forums, including Reddit, and rightfully so. A $180 peripheral has no right to act so buggy out of the box. What I’m curious about is if anyone with a currently buggy controller can replicate my results. If so, it may at least allow those with out-of-warranty controllers to enjoy their games, even if only through a wired connection to their PC. 

If it matters, I play on a Razer Blade 17 2020 edition, Core i7 with the 2080 Super Max-Q. I run the latest edition of windows 10 as of the time of this post. 

If this post is in the wrong subreddit or if I have otherwise violated any rules, please remove and point me in the right direction. I just want to get the word out.

What makes the situation interesting is my (now former) roommate was vandalizing my property, and I knew for a fact he was in my room while I was gone.

"Xbox Series X &amp; LG OLED 55 CX problems Hi All,

I've got myself an LG OLED 55 CX and an Xbox Series X. I'm very happy with my purchases, but I'm experiencing a few problems and I'm not sure if it's the TV or my Xbox. It's seems quite a few here purchased the same pair, so I thought it might be a good place to ask.

1. When I boot up my Xbox, the Xbox intro is stuttering.
2. Once I rebooted my Xbox and it started into a very weird resolution. After rebooting it again, it went back to normal.
3. Sometimes, when I start a game, my TV loses the signal. I have to go back to home blind, then pictures appears again and I can go back into the game. It doesn't happen often and not always with the same game. It seems a bit random.
4. The TV emits quite a noticeable smell. It's not super bad, but nothing I know from the other TVs I've had. Not sure if it's supposed to go away after some time.

Does anybody experience any of this and/or has any solutions?

"I have a HUGE issue So, big issue. I have fears of what the problem may be, but let me explain. First, I recently switched to Xbox from PlayStation, so I’m still kinda clueless (please no console wars). I’m currently active duty military, living in barracks, playing on barracks WiFi. I know that’s not optimal, but it’s the best I have for now. The problem is that I am having absolutely DREADFUL connection issues, but ONLY when I play call of duty. Nobody else in the barracks has the issues I have, either. I bought my Xbox One S in Poland while on rotation a handful of months ago, and it worked fine on a hotspot WiFi puck while there, no connection issues. But now that I’ve been back stateside, for about 4 months now, I regularly get DC’d from call of duty matches. Whether it be Warzone, multiplayer, or the new Cold War zombies. It’s maddening. I’ve changed my region to the United States, and my time zone to the time zone I live and play in. I’m just confused as to why every single multiplayer game I play works fine, other than call of duty. Please, for the love of all that is good, someone help me, before I lose my mind. I just want to enjoy zombies, and gain the weapon levels and camos that I should be earning.",xboxone,0

"Xbox’s demise in Europe (My first post got downvoted like crazy, why? Is discussion not allowed? I have been on Xbox for over 10yrs don’t see why being critical is shunned) 

I just wanted to start a discussion and hear the opinions of others about Xbox in Europe. 

It feels to me like Xbox has abandoned Europe and don’t really promote themselves anymore. It’s as if they have conceded to PS. 

Xbox one was a failure in Europe I’ve seen stats ranging from 70-90% of main consoles bought in Europe (PS4/XB1) being PS4 purchases. 

It seems only the UK and Ireland Xbox is still prominent. Even then PS4 outperforms Xbox. In countries like France Xbox isn’t really a thing.

This is important to me because I play competitive multiplayer games and lots of games are server based. So I’m EU locked or it’s a pain to move over to NA servers. A large playerbase is important to me. It makes the game more competitive having a larger playerbase and keeps games “alive” for longer. 

I know cross platform is becoming more common. But they’re is lots of issues. Such as if you want to cross platform you can’t do it with just console players, it bulks PC in, which I don’t want as that includes K&amp;M. 

Also communication isn’t great as you have to use in game message and party systems which aren’t as good as the consoles themselves. 

And not to mention lots of games it still isn’t a thing. 

So if Xbox are giving up on Europe I may need to move over to PS which I really don’t want to do.

"PSA : Do not buy Watchdogs Legion. As of 11/13/20 the game will stop saving progress after around 30 min of play and Ubi has no ETA on a fix. I have played watchdogs legion since launch and despite the criticism I actually really like the game however about 6 days ago I ran into an issue. I was collecting relics and tech points all around the map (there are 130 of these) and I collected them for around 2 hours and turned my system off. When I logged back on all but a few of them where back on the map and needed to be recollected. I took this as a one off and collected them all again (around 4 hours of playtime) and turned the system off. When logging back on again they were all back on the map. 

I did a little research and as of now there is a **GAME BREAKING BUG** with the xbox consoles. The game will stop saving progress after about 30 minutes of gameplay. You can work around this buy quitting the game every 25 minutes and going back in , however some missions take longer then 25 minutes to get there thus resulting in an unpassable section of the game  as you will just get caught in a loop.

[You can see here that there are 47 pages worth of reports and still no fix has been implemented.](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2292597-Progress-not-saving) There are also a ton of people reporting the issue to them via twitter as well. The issue only seems to be effecting Xbox consoles with a slight dip into pc and PlayStation. 

There has been little to no coverage on this in the games media scene either which I find odd considering this is one of the few ""next gen"" titles. The Watchdogs official twitter just states it as a known issue but is giving no ETA on a fix. 

They are deeply discounting this game already and just wanted to give a heads up to anyone thinking of purchasing this game for the series X or xbox one.",xboxone,0

"(Tech) My Mic won’t detect my voice, I’ve tried everything to fix this. Awhile ago, probably close to almost 8 months now, my Voice stopped being picked up by my mic. The Xbox detects the mic itself and says it’s plugged in, but doesn’t pick up any sound.

I’ve exhausted every option out there to fix this. Which is why I’m posting this here instead of the tech thread(Which I’ve used in the past with this issue,) because maybe more eyes on this will help me find someone who’s solved the same issue.

I’ve tried

- Going to “Audio” and making sure everything is turned on.

- Trying a new microphone and controller

- Updating my controllers &amp; Chat pad 

- Checking privacy settings to make sure I have chat enabled.

- Factory resetting and hard resetting the console 

I also got a Series X and the issue still hasn’t resolved itself. So getting an entirely new console didn’t help either. 

I’m hoping I missed something obvious and it’s a simple fix. Any help will be appreciated.",xboxone,0

"Series X intermittent black screen and speaker pop when watching movies or in the Xbox menu I've had this issue since setting up my Series X. Whenever I play a blu-ray, it will play fine for a bit, but then the screen will go black for a split second then flash white. When it flashes white, I get a loud pop from my speakers. Typically it will do this 4-5 times with about 10-20 seconds between. It's basically random however. I've watched a movie where it did 3-4 times at the start and then never again, but I've also played discs where it does it non stop throughout. This also happens within the Xboxes menu, but without the popping. Very rarely does it happen in game. The problem is mostly when watching content on disc.

I have it hooked up to a TCL series 5 through the ARC input and HDMI mode set to 2.0. The series X is set to 4K with allow 24hz, HDR, Auto HDR, and Dolby Vision. Also on 8 bit color depth, I've tried the other color depths as well and it does the same thing. I'm using the supplied HDMI cable. 

I have an Onn 4K TV that I have also used it on and it doesn't produce these issues. The Xbox is set to allow 24hz, and 50hz, and allow 4K. It doesn't have HDR.

Now I get to go through the same bullshit again next week with the Black Friday “restocks.” I feel like calling them restocks is generous if they’re only going to have a handful of units. It’s obvious that they’re production is seriously slacking, and yet they still go through this shitty launch just to make money.

"The Xbox naming scheme claims its (definitely not) first victim. My loving wife, being the awesome person she is, asked me what I would like for christmas this year. ""Xbox Series S,"" I said, ""but beware that it's very difficult to find. It's white, price is $299."" 

A week later, she says ""good news, your present is on the way!"" I was surprised and impressed that she managed to snag one. A few days go by, and the delivery from Gamestop arrives. I excitedly opened the brown cardboard shipping box to find... an Xbox One S. We had a good laugh once I explained it to her, but it's such an easy mistake to make: White console, ""Xbox"" and ""S"" in the name, and (apparently) the same price at Gamestop. Nothing about ""Series"" vs. ""One"" indicates one is an upgrade over the other.

"One of the fall's largest annual titles, Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War is hard crashing people's One X's and Series X's and I want to know why Xbox as a company isn't holding the developers of crap like this more accountable since this can permanently ruin your console. The same thing happened last year. Modern Warfare was crashing people's consoles into turning completely off. A serious software issue that some people even reported was bricking their consoles. 

Now it's begun again with the newest Call of Duty. I spent 90 bucks Canadian on a cross-generation edition and even with reduced features on my One X it's still hard crashing my system into it being turned right off. 

As far as I am concerned, this is issue should be front and center with both Treyarch the developer, and Activision, their shitbag publisher, but it doesn't seem like it. 

So you'd hope Xbox the brand and company would step up here and help their consumers out by holding the developers or publisher's liable and accountable, but I'm not seeing anything about this at all either on here or anywhere else. Where's our consumer protection against these shitbag companies who'll brick our systems with their trash and not even bother replacing anyone's stuff if it wrecks it?

I know this sounds like a whine post maybe to you, but this is a serious issue. This is now the second consecutive year in a row an annualized juggernaut like Call of Duty is hard crashing people's systems. When an error this fatal is happening, where's Xbox themselves to demand accountability from these shitbag companies that are risking our console hardware with stuff like this?

Serious question: Why isn't Xbox demanding to know why a publishers half-assed annual dumpster fire isn't working properly on our systems and causing shut-downs like this?

What does Xbox stand to lose by asking shitbag Activision wtf their problem is? Sony are the ones kissing their asses. Not Xbox.

Edit: whoa whoa whoa guys. God forbid I expect something I paid 90 bucks for to fundamentally work properly. Nevermind Xbox going to bat a little for us the little guy consumers with no voice against a company like Activision. You're totally right and this isn't a thread about that, this is about how much of a wise scholar you are and how you're also Reddit's dark horse fiduciary.

I've been getting some great online gaming over the past couple days on my new Series X, but I noticed a problem I'm having. My old Xbox Live Chat Headset that came with my OG Xbox One is starting to fall apart.

I have a very high end surround sound system, so I only use my headset for chat. I'd love a wireless headset, if possible. Main thing is that it's comfortable, and doesn't block too much sound for that ear.

I understand that they are indie and that they use their own proprietary engine (as far as I'm aware), but is it really that hard to port these games to xbox. They already have the xbox one SDK since they have ported Bastion to it.

"questions about the new gamertag system... i'm considering changing my GT from one that has numbers in it to a version without numbers (for example, going from ""Gamertag1234"" to just ""Gamertag""). i understand that with the new system, i would be randomly assigned an ID tag after the GT since i won't be the first one to use the name (""Gamertag#604"" in my example).

what i don't know is how this is going to display on my xbox profile/to my friends, and to people i'm in multiplayer games with. for example, i play a lot of dead by daylight cross-platform with friends who play PS4, PC, and switch. if i'm in a lobby with them (or other xbox players) are they going to see my name as ""Gamertag"" or ""Gamertag604""? 

my whole reasoning for changing my GT is to get rid of the numbers being visible to people i play with, so if they're going to show up anyway instead of just being used as a search function to distinguish between xbox profiles i don't see the point in changing it at all.

"Video game noobie with a Q about Skyrim vs. Assassins Creed Hi! I am brand new to video games but recently fell in love with Zelda Breath of the Wild and want to find something similarly open world/ beautiful/ and filled with puzzles and side quests/main storylines that really take time to think about. I tried the Witcher, which was great, but found it was a little too much ""kill this"" ""collect this"" with no real puzzle or brainteasing element and I began to feel bored. After doing some research it seems like Skyrim and Assassins Creed are both beautiful open world games and was curious which you think might fill this void more! Thank you so much!!",xboxone,0

So I play games like Apex Legends, Hollow Knight, and others (all of which are fairly recent games).  

The night before, I sit down and play, nothing weird. Then, when I hopped on this afternoon to play, half my library is uninstalled. I checked with my family to see if they uninstalled anything...nothing. (I'm the last one to play and my brother is the first one on. He noticed it) No clue as to why games I played the night before, like Apex Legends, just uninstalled. 

Extra Info: 

I just got gamepass and was installing Battlefront II, maybe installing games deletes others for space? 

I had the Xbox One since December 2015, (Manufacture date: -July 2015). Doesn't look like there's anything wrong in the console when running.

This is the second time it happened. Before it just randomly uninstalled 1 game. Now, it's half my library. I'm thinking that the console is just getting old, and stuff just starts bugging out. Anyway, that's it. If you have questions or any suggestions, I'll try to respond as best as I can. Thanks!",xboxone,0

"Why is contacting someone in Xbox Support such a hassle now? You can’t get someone on the phone now, they have to call you. And if you try support chat, literally every option on why you’re contacting them says you can’t chat on this issue.... I’ve been trying to contact Xbox Support for the past few days over a refund request I put in many many days ago. And you can’t get one after 14 days. So the longer they wait the longer I probably won’t get it.

Every single chat support option ends up saying you can’t chat with someone over this issue and links you to a virtual assistant that’s fake, or sends you to forums. If you try to call support, you can’t even get someone on the line anymore, at all. You can have to submit your number for the chance for them to call you back....

"Always showing online on PC Hello, I have found a posts talking about this but nothing to fix it. Basically I have Xbox game bar on my PC signed into my Xbox account. As a result, it says I am online on PC all day and I get invited a bunch through the day. It is very frustrating and the only options I have seen are to appear offline whenever I turn off my Xbox which is stupid and to sign out of game bar. Obviously I am not going to sign in and out of game bar everyday so if these are the only options I am just going to sign out and and never use it again. Please tell me there is a reasonable way to just not have your account show online when not on Xbox.

Safe mode works fine.  I try to update to 8.01 via network however it never finishes the install, merely continues to halt on boot.

I have swapped the power cable.  HDMI works fine as the initial PS logo appears, along with safe mode.

I don't care about earning trophies because there is no sense of satisfaction to it anymore. The smart thing sony can do now is tie in prizes and rewards to platinum trophies.

"Is it worth getting a standard model PS4? I'm a bit hesitant to get a Pro model, because the prices I've seen for those are approaching the prices of a digital PS5. However, the standard PS4 models is only about $300 new for me, and I was thinking maybe I could get a base model PS4 for now, and then get the PS5 later on down the road.

Especially because of the scalping situation, where PS5s are extremely difficult to obtain, and might not be available for months. Getting myself a PS4 in the meanwhile, might just do the job.

The only games I really want for the system anyway, are the PS4 games. PS5, there aren't really any games yet that I'd need the console for (but it does have the SSD that makes load times shorter). That's why I was wondering if a standard PS4 will do the trick (and I can probably get past the load times).

One thing I'm worried about, is the support for the system down the road. Not to mention the PS4 Pro eventually became the standard, and I don't know how more modern (2018-20) games were designed with the standard model in mind, like Crash 4.

Is it worth getting a standard PS4 for me? I don't really plan on playing super-demanding games. The games I intend to play are stuff like Cuphead, A Hat in Time, the Witness, Shadow of the Colossus, Furi, Dark Souls Remastered, that kind of thing.

Also, I'm wondering how many people will get the same idea to instead get the PS4 because of the issue with PS5 stock, and how that would affect PS4 stock.",PS4,1

"PS4 US code didn't redeem on Fortnite  Hello.

​

Yesterday I bought the Neo Versa bundle that I redeemed online, on the [my.playstation.com](https://my.playstation.com/) website.  
I don't have a PS4, so I asked a friend. He entered my account and then Fortnite, but I still don't have the skin and vbucks.

Any idea?",PS4,1
"Why does the PS Store not have all versions of a game go on sale at the same time? I've been a PC gamer for many years and when a game goes on sale on Steam, Uplay, GoG, etc, *every* version of the game is on sale.  You can buy the base game for 50% off, the Deluxe for 50% off, the Ultimate for 50% off, etc.

With my PS3 this was never a problem because I always bought physical copies of games, and for the most part, I've bought all my PS4 games on physical, too.  The problem is that many older games are *really* hard to find physical copies of at a reasonable price.  

The last few big PS Store sales, I've decided to check on some games I've been interested in and nearly every time, the base game is on sale, and the other versions that include all of the extra content are still full price.  I'm just wondering if this is common or if I've been unlucky?  

I'm also kind of wondering if the PS Store does this on purpose to sucker you in on a great deal to get the base game and then they can charge you full price for the DLC season pass that they know you will want to get?

I've also had bad luck with games I'm interested in not going on sale at all during some of the big sales.  I guess I'm just spoiled with the big Steam sales when pretty much the entire store goes on sale 3 or 4 times per year.",PS4,1

"Ps4 overheating after I cleaned it So about an hour ago I cleaned my ps4’s fan because it was being super loud. So I basically removed the bottom slide, took out the power supply and spray out all the dust I could see in the fan and the heatsink and whatnot. But after I reassembled it, plug it in and turned it on, the fan got super loud, turned off and the console flashed this red light. I googled what the red light meant and it said that it means that the console is overheating. I think this is strange because it’s never done that before and I removed all the dust which prevents that from happening, right?. Do you guys have any advice on how to fix it or should I head to a electronics repair store and see if they can fix it?",PS4,1

"Wired DS4 audio issues when both ports in use? Hey, bought used recently and it's been perfect besides one thing. I get a little static/stuttering wirelessly with the DS4 audio, I sit close to the PS4 too. Just a bit annoying. One of the cables doesn't fix anything when connected to the controller but it's crap, walmart brand, and the other is great, audio is perfectly clear when connected.

But if I have the crap cable for charging my phone (wireless charger, doesn't matter probably tho) and the other connected to the controller, the audio goes back to being problematic. As if it was receiving audio through bluetooth, even though wired.

I'm cool with just using one port at a time, just curious if anybody else has had this issue. Maybe it's just putting less power into each as it's having to handle more, idk. I've swapped ports and same thing. Probably nothing serious, and everything else had been fine.",PS4,1

I plugged in the microphone in the mic port and it made a loud chirp then proceeded to create static. Along with that, the joysticks feel as if there not understanding what I'm doing. As in, when I move r3 to the left it moves and then keeps going for a bit when I let go. This uncontrolled movement is not normal, my other controllers dont do it. Also, the r2, l2, l1, and r1 arent working well. The controller doesnt seem to keep up with me, I hit the r2 butter in rapid succession and it doesnt perform the action o want it to. For example, I have a handgun with 12 bullets. I spam the r2 trigger to fire all the bullets out of the gun quickly, my other controller allowed that to happen. The new controller doesnt always perform the action of pulling the trigger, regardless of how hard I pull it. If anyone has any idea how to fix it or and tech support people willing to help it would be great. This controller was 6p bucks and It would be shame it it didnt work.",PS4,1

I have a PS4 Pro if that makes any difference and ping is fine for online play. I will likely grab a PS5 in the New Year.

I like a shooter but not stupid fast pace ideally. I also quite like strategy and simulation games, but am open to all sorts. Gameplay typically beats story as well for me. 

Is there anything that you'd recommend as a must play? Bonus if it's on sale in EU but doesn't have to be. I was set on getting God of War, but learned it would be included with the PS5 online so might hold off.

"Looking for someone I once knew Looking for a friend I once had on PS4

Throwaway account..
Sorry for the subpar title and this is seriously a LONG SHOT and I’m not sure where to post this so if anyone has any better threads to post it to, please LMK. 
Anyway. I’m out of ideas. We met on Grand Theft Auto V online (PS4 obviously) 4 or 5 years ago. He was in his mid to late 20s (now he would be in his early 30s I believe). He and I got really close and would just always play heists together (we did use voice chat and stuff). Eventually I played less and less and just ended up getting really busy with my life and we ended up never online at the same time. I ended up messaging him, he messaged back and I would forget and not reply for a month and he wouldn’t reply for a month and so on so forth. We sent about one message a month for about a year and I ended up getting his number to message him on WhatsApp. He was from the UK and I am from the US. We were super close for a couple years and talked regularly for quite some time... then we had a vicious falling out. I don’t recall the reason why exactly, but it happened. 
About two years pass and here we are now. I logged onto the PlayStation (which I no longer own, it is my brothers and I’m home temporarily) and I saw his username and I thought about messaging him and never did and now I can’t find his account anymore (I think I deleted the message or follow or smth in a moment of “I want to forget” mentality). 
I really want to message him, I want to talk to him again. We were super close. I just want closure almost, or to figure out why we distanced. 
I still have his phone number but it’s no longer registered to WhatsApp and I can’t text it since it’s an international number. I vaguely remember his username and stuff, but I haven’t been able to find his account when searching for it in the friends search sections online. 
His username was either Hassan or Hasan and the second half started with S and was like Saas or sash or something along those lines, it was one word (no underscore basically). And I remember the picture he had as his avatar/profile photo (it was the same picture for both), at least i have narrowed it down to two. 
Really there is nothing I can ask anyone to do unless someone happens to have someone fitting this description (early thirties by now, British accent, username being some combination of Hassan/hasan saas/sash, and if they ever happened to talk to a girl from the United States and play GTAV together constantly) in their friends list.
Frankly just wanted to get this off my chest and vent about the whole thing lmao. But hey if anyone knows anyone fitting the description hmu lol",PS4,1

"What’s a good external storage device? So, I’ve blown through all of my PS4 Pro’s storage and I’d rather not have to juggle deleting and reinstalling games. I’ve been looking at various external storage options recently, but I think I just need some recommendations from people with experience. While the ones I’ve looked at have mostly gotten good reviews, there’s a concerning number of reviews claiming they broke within roughly a year or earlier. I was just wondering if any of you have had a good one that’s worked for longer than a year. It can be HDD or SSD (if an SSD actually works with a PS4 Pro since all I’ve found are HDDs). All of my games are discs if that makes any difference. Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Also, kind of a side question, but one of the negative reviews for one claimed that the external drive broke, and when it did, it took their entire console down with it and they had to do a factory reset or reinitialize it or whatever it’s called which caused them to lose everything. Is that actually possible? Cause if so, I might just not risk it and just juggle my games.",PS4,1

"Play of the Past: vote for the PS4 classic you want to discuss! [Game Thread Voting] (November 30 2020) https://preview.redd.it/jchycohooay51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7fdbcf8ae33f632f4ab5de834e5b6594c28ebe3

Hi everyone,

There has been changes to how Game Discussion Threads are now handled. Now, **every major release will automatically have its own Discussion Thread**, and it will be the same for the **PlayStation Plus monthly games**.

As the PS5 is now here, it's now time to look back and discuss what made the great days of the PS4. As such, the Game Voting Thread will now be about **older games** (hence the name **Play of the Past**). So the latest big release will no longer automatically win, because it will have its own thread anyway.

**How does it work?**

1. Reply to this post with a game you'd like to see have its own discussion thread stickied at the top of the subreddit this week.
2. Vote for other games in the comments you'd like to see as well.
3. The top game will be given a game thread this week.

**Rules:**

1. One game per top-level comment. It will otherwise be ignored.
2. The game must be released and available to play on PS4. **It has to be at least 1 year old.** Exceptions can be made for more recent games that didn't have a discussion thread.
3. Try to **avoid duplicates** as they tend to dilute the voting.  If the top two comments are the same game, it will still only get one thread for the week.
4. If a game was selected for the Play of the Past thread in the past year (365 days), it has to wait a year before being eligible again. If a game gets its thread on December 3, 2020, it can't have another Play of the Past thread until at least December 2, 2021.

To view all recent game threads, [**click here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/search?q=flair%3A%22game+discussion%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all).

I thought since the PS4 system is no longer being made or sold by Sony, as they are now pushing the PS5, how nice would it be if we could remove the apps we don't pay for, or want to appear in the tv &amp; video program. Like for me I would remove Disney +, Hulu, prime video, peacock (whatever that is), HBO max, Apple Tv, and funimation. 

That way I could finally see all of the 4 apps I do have installed on the one strip without having to scroll all the way to the end to get to the others.

Netflix is always second after Disney+, but if I watch youtube and then want to switch to plex, I have to go back to tv &amp; video, scroll all the way to the end of the row, and then press right one more time to get it to load all of the apps I have installed so I can switch to Plex, if I then later want to switch back to youtube I have to repeat this process over. Same is I want to use the LittleStar Cinima program for VR videos.


Better yet, it would be so amazing I I could finally just add these 4 apps that I use to my home screen, and out them into their own folder, instead of even having to go into this stupid Tv &amp; Video app sony has forced on us.

It's so anyoing, and I know the Xbox systems are so much easier to customize, why you can even pin the netflix, and youtube app to a tab on the main screen, rather than having to open a tv &amp; video app, and then scroll all the way to the right and then press right once more to get to see all of the ones you want to switch to or see.",PS4,1

"Remote Play (Stability and Disconnect Issue) I am trying to used PS4 Remote Play and it is glitchy as hell. I even plugged the darned thing into Ethernet and it was still glitchy. I have a gigabit connection... so that can’t be it. 

Also, even on WiFi, I’m getting over 90mbps on this device. So, it should be working flawlessly. Instead, it loses connection constantly and is shitty in general.

I might add that I use steam link all of the time and it isn’t near as glitchy. It certainly doesn’t lose connection completely like the PS4 does.

I’m wondering if port forwarding would do me any good at this point. 

I have a Google Nest mesh network if that helps. Again, I plugged it straight into Ethernet and that did absolutely nothing for stability",PS4,1

"The writing for The Last of Us 2 isn't lazy by any means I just finished the game and one of the main complaints I've seen before and after I played it was, ""Oh the pacing and writing is lazy. They did stuff to be lazy. The story is lazy."" 
 
I think that's wrong though. If the storytelling was lazy, then the entire story would be predicatable and (some people might not like this) the ending would've been a happy ending if the writing was lazy. 
 
I think if the devs wanted to just get a story out as quickly as possible then Ellie would've done a backflip and kill Abby on day 3 in Seattle and then everyone would go back to Jackson and the end. 
 
This is not the case, cause the ending for this game is depressing and dark. Not because you don't get revenge for Joel, but because you realize what revenge did to everyone around you. Playing as Abby wasn't attempting to make the player like her as a hero, it was just getting her perspective of what revenge on Joel did to her entire crew of friends. Playing as Ellie, you saw Jessie get shot in vain and Tommy did a 180. 
 
The story was not about Ellie killing Abby, it was about Ellie finding closure with Joel after cutting him off for like 3 years. At the end, no one really got revenge. It makes you thing, or at least it should make you think. 
 
This story does have stupid moments, but to call the writing lazy is just disrespectful. I feel like most people are hating the story because there was no happy ending, but the moral is that sometimes you don't get the happy ending.",PS4,1

"Best internet settings for streaming games?  

Hi All,

I am a bit of a tech nerd, but mostly with hardware and mainstream products; I don't know much about the software end of things or the IT end. I am wondering how I should configure my network to maximize speed/latency/overall playability of Stadia, and PS4 remote play. Here's what I know:

* Live in NY with Spectrum. I have the Ultra package which is 400 down and around 20 up. They have a monopoly on the area so I can't get anything else until FiOS gets here.
* I have a modem of some kind (I paid a lot for it and it's supposed to be high quality) and Nest Wifi for my router. I have the setting enabled to prioritize gaming.
* I like to play stadia from my phone and laptop, and I also play PS4 remote play from laptop and phone as well. On my phone I use PSPlay, not the official PS Remote Play app because it does not officially support 3rd party controllers. To use the app, I had to enable port forwarding, if that means anything.
* I also downloaded WLAN Optimizer and changed the settings in there that are supposed to help streaming videos and such.

Any other settings or things I can change to maximize the potential of my network to stream Stadia and PS4 Remote Play? It's running great right now, just want to make sure there's anything I'm missing.

Not a huge Marvel fan but, Spider-man had always been awesome to me. Only movies ive seen are non MCU ones. I simply couldn’t handle this ending...

Ottos pain and anger, revealing he knew about Peter despite attacking him.

I got teared up at Peters “I hate you for making me do this!!” during the final fight. Such good acting and really solidified their bond and his commitment despite the pain.

Then the Aunt May scene. I was already on edge- but character deaths have never gotten me emotional before. It was Peters “I didnt want you to worry” that for the first time ever had tears down my face. Ive never been so moved by a work of fiction. How this wasnt straight adapted to a movie is beyond me. This game is freaking perfect.",PS4,1

"Why doesn't my TV recognize a surround signal during blu-ray playback from my PS4 or PS5? I have a problem with audio output when playing media on disc on my PS4 or PS5...

I have a PS5 connected via HDMI to a Vizio PX65-G1. The TV is connected to a soundbar via optical cable. When the TV is getting a 5.1+/surround signal it will display ""dolby audio"" and will output this to the sound bar as well, which blinks a little light to signal it is receiving surround audio.

After setting the PS5 to output ""Bitstream Dolby"" audio, both the TV and the sound bar recognize a surround signal during games, streaming media, and DVD discs.

Furthermore, when playing a regular or HD blu-ray disc and setting the output to ""bitstream"" the TV and soundbar recognize a surround signal during the disc menus.

During actual playback of video from a blu ray disc, however, the output reverts to stereo and is only recognized as a stereo signal by both the TV and sound bar. This happens even if I try the ""fix"" I've found online of setting the output to ""bitstream"" in the Blu-Ray menu during playback.

I had this same problem with my PS4 as well and never really figured out an answer. Is there a way to make the consoles output a surround signal over HDMI while playing a blu ray disc? Is this a quirk with my TV or setup? Is it a limitation of the hardware?",PS4,1

"I physically can't push my joystick all the way right First or all, the copper contacts and everything on the actual joystick is working perfectly. No drifting, nothing is broken. I've checked the input without the joystick cap and it works perfectly.

Now, the issue is that when I push the joystick to the right when the controller is fully assembled, the physical joystick bumps into the shell before it reaches +1.0 input. But only on the right stick when it moves right.

I've checked with the motherboard separated from the controller and then it works fine. But when I assemble the controller, it feels like the joystick is way too inside the shell. So it bumps into the plastic before doing the complete input.

I've also tried changing the joystick cap, tightening/loosing screws, 
even bending the plastic inside as to have the joystick stick out correctly. I've been here for hours and it's incredibly frustrating that it just won't fix.

Does anyone have any *ANY* idea what else I can do? I don't know if I'm describing it good enough. I'll get some pictures.",PS4,1

I think it had something to do with it being in the middle of an update.

I've reboot my licences, nothing.
I've tried saving game files, nothing.

Haha I just purchased a new Samsung Q80T TV and the streaming apps like HBO Max and Disney Plus load up extremely fast, have quick UI, and have no buffer during playback.

They are both located in the exact same spot in my home and are both connected to the exact same network and frequency (2.4GHZ).

"Friendly reminder for those with a PS4 with plans to eventually get a PS5: Bugsnax is available free on PS+ until tomorrow for the PS5 but you can still claim it if you don't own the console yet. Pretty much as the title says. I'd forgotten about this, I normally claim the PS4 titles from the store on the console so it doesn't show up. But for those with a PS4 who want to start stocking up on games for the PS5 thanks to PS+, you can still claim the free PS5 version of Bugsnax by logging in to the PS store on your browser. Just add it to your library and when you eventually get a PS5 you'll still be able to play the game for free.

I'm guessing a lot of people will have already done this but hopefully this helps out a few people.",PS4,1

"Favorite “just for fun” games? I was one of the lucky ones that got a PS5 last week during the Best Buy release, and it has become my story-driven, graphics-intensive, triple-A game playing console; however, I didn’t want to just let the PS4 sit in a closet unused, so I moved it to my office with the intent of using it for more casual gaming (when I don’t want a deep story, just some low-stakes fun). I’m looking for recommendations for games that fit that definition, be they indie games, casual games, or multiplayer online games. I was hoping that /r/ps4 could give me some of their favorite casual games that should have a spot on my console.",PS4,1

"To everybody that craves a PS5, but can't get it in the near future: consider buying an SSD for your PS4! During Black Friday, the Samsung 860 Evo 500GB was 49.90Euro here in Germany and as I most likely won't get a PS5 until next year, I decided that replacing my old HDD in my PS4 Slim would be a good way to slightly improve my gaming experience and make it easier to cope with the fact of not owning a PS5. Low and behold did this upgrade do exactly that. Sluggish OS? Gone. Texture popins in COD? Gone. Long ass loading times in RDR2? Gone. Now, to be clear, an SSD won't improve fps or make the PS4 feel as snappy as PS5, but sure does it make it feel like a ""good enough"" of an upgrade until I eventually get my hands on a PS5. Wish I did this earlier.

P.S. Fuck scalpers. Also, don't buy a DRAM-less SSD. I bought a Crucial BX500 beforehand and while the load times were faster, the game ran worse after a while compared to my old HDD (random texture popins and freezes).",PS4,1

"PS4 controllers won't connect back to PS4 console Hi there. 
I'm in the situation that I have two controllers that won't connect to my playstation after having been used paired with another playstation. Both controllers work(ed) fine, and there is still life in them (glowing bar on the back still lights up and everything). 

But when I try to connect them back to my PS4, they just blink white a bunch before turning off again. I've tried to do all of the steps that I've been able to find on Google (reset controller, use a cable, turn on/off PS4, and so on), but none of them works. 
The only thing I suspect might be a problem, is the cable that I use for connecting the controller to the console. The cable works fine with charging the controllers, but it might not work for connecting the controller back to the PS4, I guess? I don't have another micro USB cable, so I'd have to buy one to see if that's the case though. 

I really don't want to buy another controller since I'll hopefully get the PS5 ""soon"" (probably won't get it before another few months, but you get the point). I know that you can use the PS4 controkler on a PS5, but yeah, I'd still like to avoid having to buy another",PS4,1

"PS4 unresponsive, worrying error. Please help. Good morning.

This has happened for a while now and Google hasn't helped me.

When watching TV on the Sky app the media will often pause and show a yellow circle. My controller (both of them) are unresponsive and show a bright white light. The only way out is to hold down the power on the PS4 (manual reset) and then manually switch back on again. 


Most of the time when I'm watching Sky it is for live football (soccer) and it takes about 4 minutes to switch off, switch back on and then get back to the sport.


Details about my PS4:

Star Wars battlefront 1 edition (approx 5 years old)

Only lightly used (I game probably 10 hours a month)

Error happens 90% of the time that I am watching Sky so i can rely on it crashing at least once during a match if not more.

It has happened twice when playing Red Dead Redemption 2. I can't say whether this is game specific as the error has only happened in the last two years and RDR2 is the game I've played 90% of the time in the past 2 years.

2 years ago I got a 2tb Western digital external hard drive and I keep my games on there. Perhaps this is a factor?


Any help would be great. It's got to the point that I'm considering getting a PS5 for all the wrong reasons (as I rarely game). I would much rather carry on with my PS4. Thanks",PS4,1

I know I should be posting this on the CP Reddit (and I did but my post got closed).

Is it a lot of menus with stats and individual leveling up of endless loots? Like a hardcore RPG?

Or are we talking more (new) Assassins Creed / Deus Ex with light RPG elements?

I got banned twice in 2 weeks I've been auto banned for shit I did months ago twice now. Seeing as I've never been banned before until now in all of the years I've been on psn. Why you might ask.

I dont believe I would get reported for an image I sent 6 months ago by one of my friends. It got auto flagged.

And the PS store is fine, much better than using it on the PS4 that is slow, will crash my base PS4 every now and then, and generally not good.

"PS4 Constant Crashing This has probably been asked a lot but I honestly can't find any single solid answer. Recently my PS4 has been acting strangely like random crashes while playing a game but today it has completely crashed to the point where it hardly functions, it was stuck in the loop of checking the system loading the logo and then nothing else loads afterward, it's just a black screen. I spent the entirety of my day trying to fix this like manually reinstalling the 8.01 update, taking out the hard drive and reinserting it, changing resolution from safe mode, restarting from safe mode, unplugging/plugging back in, even initializing my PS4, the whole shebang but it still crashes constantly. Specifically with Genshin Impact it seems to completely malfunction as it doesn't reinstall it fully and it will freeze, crash, and then go to a black screen. It'll work for a short time after selecting change resolution from safe mode but after a bit it'll freeze and crash.

"HELP!! Controller issue?!? So I’ve been looking online for a solution but didn’t really find anything. Forgive me if this has already been answered.

I started playing GTAV on my PS4 today. I haven’t played it in a few year since I had my PS3. So this is my first time playing it on PS4.

I started the game and immediately I was having problems with the camera spinning around the characters on its own. Like I would not even be touching the controller and it would be spinning around. 

I switched to my backup controller and had no problem at all. I charged up my main one to see if maybe the low battery was an issue. I switched over once it was charged and it wasn’t as bad as before, but definitely still there. 

I used a dust blaster to clean around the joysticks and the problem still persists. 

Also to note, I have not had any problems like this with the controller as long as I’ve had it. It’s only occurred since today when I started GTAV. So I’m not sure if it’s a problem with the game (other controller works fine) or the controller???

Any suggestions? Thank you",PS4,1

"Question I’ve had forever: Why does the PS4 not receive upload and download speeds like a mobile device or PC would? Hi guys! Sorry if this question is stupid, but I’ve always been curious. The internet speeds I get are usually 300 mbps down and 50+ mbps up on my PC and on my phone from the WiFi I have.The PS4 receives max speeds of 110-170 mbps down and 5 max up on the same WiFi.Obviously these conditions are still great for gaming and don’t hinder my gaming or shareplay experience, but what is it about the PS4 that doesn’t allow it to receive the speeds my other devices do?

"Anyone ever have library issues with Mortal Kombat X? Has anyone on here had trouble finding the game in both your library and your purchases? Back in 2017, I had purchased MKX for very cheap during a PS Store sale. Uninstalled it after beating the story, etc, never been a mega fan. Wife wanted to fire it up again yesterday, so I went looking for it in both my library and my purchases. No luck. Eventually searched for it on the store and found it that way, downloaded it just fine without having to rebuy it or anything like that.

First time that’s happened to me.

I typically uninstall games once I’m done with them unless I really like them and might fire them up again or feel fond of them being on the home screen. I also usually “claim” the PS Plus games in case I wanna try them out one day, since they just go into your library.

That’s why this was so strange to me. I thought maybe I had not bought it but that it was a PS Plus game one month. Even still, like I said it took searching for it to find it.",PS4,1

"Third update on PS4 crashing when playing some games I had posted before on here about the ""Cannot continue using the application. The data is corrupted, uninstall the application and reinstall"" error. At first I thought it was a faulty external drive. Replaced it with a new one, no luck. I rebuilt the database several times, it did nothing. Then I thought the internal hard drive was the issue. I replaced it this morning with a new one and initialized the PS4. Then I try to install the same two games that were giving me this error, and the issue persists. I have noticed too, that I get various error messages when introducing these two games.

Sometimes I get a ""Cannot start the application error"", sometimes I get a ""Unsupported disc"" error, and sometimes I get a ""Corrupted data"" error. The two discs in question are flawless they don't have a single scratch or fingerprint, and one of them is a brand new game (AC Valhalla), and I'm very careful when introducing my discs on the console, so there's no way that that disc (at least) is faulty. The only explanation I can think of is that the disc reader is dirty or damaged, but then why would it fail to read just two single discs and nothing else? 

I'm getting really annoyed by this. My Slim PS4 is exactly one year old and it's giving me trouble already. I had an XB1 for 7 years and to this day it has never given me issues. Any idea if sending my PS4 to Sony to get it fixed would be very expensive? Should I venture and try to open the PS4 myself to clean the lens?",PS4,1

"A question about the file transfers from the PS4 to the PS5 So I’ll make this as short as I can:

-Was a kid, lived in Africa, went to Australia to visit my cousin and ended up creating my first PSN account there with a real email.
-Years later, moved to Portugal, had to create a new PSN account in order to use PS Plus since it’s region locked. But my dumb ass for some reason created with a fake email.
-Some more years later (now), will transition to the PS4 to the PS5 and don’t want to lose the games I own on the account with fake email.

MY QUESTION is: Since I’m still logged in on the account in my PS4 when I transfer everything to the PS5, will the PS5 ask me for the password again?

The site which gave me the fake email doesn’t accept that email anymore and I’ve tried to reach PS tech support for two days now with no luck.

I wouldn’t like to lose the account because of the games I own there, plus I’ve still got a few months of subscription in the account but I know it’s a possibility.

Also besides the question, any advice is welcome. I don’t know if I should just forget the account, keep insisting on PS tech support or the file transfer will save me.",PS4,1

-Messages and parties linked
-parties are extremely hard to use now
-A lot more crashes
-Community parties have been removed completely 

1. Messages and parties being linked are stupid. What if you want to be in a party alone. Now you can’t. Also this makes new members in the party have instant access to this chat. 

2. You can’t just add people to a party. Instead you have to make a whole new chat just to add someone in. It’s way harder than before. 

3. Self explanatory. 

4. This was the way me and MILLIONS of others connected to knew people and made friends. It was perfect. Now you have to seek through the chat box and find someone, add them, message them for invite, and wait for everyone to get there which could be 10 min and THEN get invited bc he can’t just keep adding onto party. And most of the time they give up and your waiting for like 20 min for something that isn’t gonna happen. 

5. I forgot to mention people are getting banned for trash talking now. Sometimes people are joking around and or just serious with the game. Also what if a group a friends are joking and one gets butt hurt and reports him and then the guy gets banned for a month. Like wtf.

"13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim - Highly Recommended I honestly have not played any game like this. The first 10minutes had me hooked in its cold mech grip, and I couldn't put it down. From the artstyle, the music - the execution of its *stellar* story - down to the tower defense gameplay; this was an amazing trip that will challenge your critical and analytical skills.

This is a thinking person game, and I appreciated every moment of it.

I recognize that this game isn't gettin a lot of love due to its obscurity. But if you get a chance, I'd recommend you pick this one up.",PS4,1

"If I re-initialize my PS4, will I lose data saved to an external USB hard drive? So yeah, power went out last night (I was using a surge protector) and it messed up my PS4. It wouldn't play any games and would freeze if I tried to go into Settings. I rebuilt the database and now it won't even start, so I have to reinitialize the PS4.

My games are saved to an external HDD. If I reinitialize the PS4, will I lose the games saved to the HDD? Do I need to unplug the HDD before reinitializing the PS4 or can I leave it in?",PS4,1
"PS4 flipping between saying External Drive needs to be formatted or not recognizing it at all Was playing FFXV and tried to play a DLC episode. Most would load but one wouldn't. Tested a couple of others games and they would load fine. PS4 would prompt me to repair the HDD every time I tried to run this DLC. Prompted me again when restarting PS4.

I thought maybe that particular game was corrupted so I deleted it to reinstall. Halfway through it stopped, and I couldn't delete the unfinished download (got the code that typically signs HDD failure). I checked my External Hard Drive on my laptop and it recognized it fine, says it's working properly.

PS4 would say the drive needs to be formatted, and then if left idle, would then prompt me to repair it, say it failed, and then to format it, but My Passport disappeared at that point, as if not plugged in.

I unplugged the drive, updated PS4, and rebuilt the Database, but the same issue persists. It goes from recognizing the drive but saying it needs to be formatted, to telling me it needs to be repaired, to failing the repair, to disappearing.

Anyone know what could be causing this?

"Game audio randomly mismatching At first I noticed while playing GTA San Andreas the game would slow down and stutter, eventually to a small freeze.

 But at the same time I was beginning a playthrough of the Witcher 3, good game, but it also seems to make the system run pretty hard. Didn't take too long to notice it was beginning to mismatch my game audio randomly, so sometimes the characters will talk on screen with a delay to their vocals, and then the next character would start talking in the middle of the delayed audio from the previous character as if they were just talking over them (both voices can be heard at the same time) but the 2nd characters audio may actually be perfectly aligned with their movements as they should be
 Now at this point it's happening to every game I play. It makes cutscenes nearly unwatchable and ruins getting to actually listen to and understand what's going on in the game.

It's been a problem for quite some time now, but now it's just driving me up the wall and not play new games simply because it ruins them

"Insane fact: Whenever Naughty Dog releases a game there's a 67% chance it will be game of the year, winning more GOTY awards then any other game. Since Naughty Dog started releasing Uncharted games in 2007 they have won more GOTY awards then any other developer for Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 4. And since they started releasing The Last of Us games they've won for the first game and with scores given so far it looks like they'll win for their 2nd game also. Out of the last 6 games they've released 4 have won GOTY with the only ones not winning being Uncharted 1 and 3. It's just insane to me that with all the game developers out there that whenever Naughty Dog releases a game they have not only a better then 50/50 chance to win GOTY they have a 67% chance to make a game that's decided to be better then all others.

Of course 6 games isn't a huge sample size but AAA studious can only make so many games over a certain period of time so I thought it was fair to use. Naughty Dog is probably my favorite studio and whenever they release a new game I know I'm in for a treat. I can't wait to see what their next game will be, if it's the new IP space game I know it will be amazing and if it's another Last of Us game I know that will be great to.

The screen displayed text that said ""Select a user who is a family manager. You can also create a new user to be the family manager."" So I clicked on the new user button.

also i fear the the old games would be old and clunky since they came out a while ago but i understand that i need to play them before KH3 for story development.

"Guide: Why your DLCs don't work I realize this could be common knowledge, but since I spent way more time figuring this out than I probably should, I feel like this could perhaps help someone.

So, when buying the base game and the DLC separately *their region must match.* That's because DLC content purchased through the store is *region locked.* You can play whatever region game on whatever PS4 system, but you *can't* link any region DLC to any region base game. I didn't know this and struggled with it, thought it was a bug till I checked that the region don't match.

How do you overcome buying DLCs that can't be linked to the base game?

1. When buying a game, buy the ""special edition"" with the DLC in it.
2. When buying the DLC separately (if the DLCs are yet to release or if you've already purchased the base game without the DLC), be sure to check that the region match in both.
3. You buy both, digitally, from the same store (which kinda sucks if you already have the base game purchased)

How to check the region of the disc (physical copy):

1. On the spine of the box, next to/below the title of the game or on the dics itself is a code (f.e. ""CUSA 07708"")
2. Type the code to ""Search everything..."" bar on  [serialstation.com](https://serialstation.com) (website with a database of these codes)
3. You should be able to find the region of the game next to it's name and other information under ""Serials"".

How to check the region of the DLC:

1. On PS4, check the region of the PS store on an account you're buying from, PS Store &gt; Storefront Country. (Should match the region of the account)

Now you know the region of both and you can decide whether its safe to buy the DLC from the store or not. Don't do the same mistake of buying it, refunding it, then later buying it again and in the end buying the base game again, just like me, so I can finally play it.",PS4,1

What the guy didn’t advise me was that ONLY the official data transfer cables will actually pair the controllers with the system. Regular charging cables (which seem to be the only type anywhere sells) will NOT.

Basically, my sister often watches me while I play, and she did play skyrim once for a couple hours, she didn't get very far as she had literally never played a video game before so she had trouble moving and getting used to turning and stuff. I want to get some games on my ps4 for her, that she would like and would get her used to using a controller if she ever wants to play some of the other games I have.

She likes puzzle games, so anything like that, some easier game, no fps games or really any shooters i don't think to start with, ya know? I'm coming home for Christmas from uni and spending next semester home with her so I think she would like to play some video games to destress. 

I appreciate any recommendations! I just want to really introduce my sister to the wonderful world of gaming. :)",PS4,1

"DualShock Doesn't Work In Game I was trying to fix an analog stick drift issue and after putting the controller back together, everything seemed fine. The DualShock had power, the LED bar lit up, my PS4 turned on via the controller, I could navigate the menus, I could select options with the X button but as soon as I went into game, nothing happens. I tried loading Ghost of Tsushima and it just stays at the title screen and I can't get past it no matter what button I press. AC Odyssey stays at the ""Press X to Start"" screen.

The good thing is, you can actually remove the cable from the controller. The end which you connect to the controller is completely the same as the normal DualShock 4, with the other end being a USB A which sticks to the PS4.

I was wondering if I could make it wireless by connecting some device as I saw something similar on Amazon many years ago. For example, a small pen drive looking thing on the controller and a receiver on the PS4, either by Bluetooth or 2.4GHZ/5GHZ (sorry I am completely noob at these).

I really want to use the controller as I love my sister and she is so adorable and is the only one who watches and supports me when I game.",PS4,1

 \- Contacting PS Store support (the automated phone line directs me to a support page that they say will have a live chat, but there's no live chat link when I get there. The phone line hangs up on me after this without ever speaking to a human)

"I believe my account was stolen, and I'm at a loss  

I'll keep this short. Maybe one of you can offer advice.

On November 25, this past Wednesday, I noticed about $258 worth of purchases made to my Sony account that I DID NOT authorize. Pretty much immediately, I went through the motions of security perseveration.

I put in my refund request only hours after the charges had been made, but I've not heard anything back from them about it since. Checking my account on the website, none of the purchases are listed as having been ""Played"" or ""Downloaded"", so I'm hoping for good results.

This evening, I come to find out that my PS4 had been deactivated, and switched out for... some other PS4 out there, most likely, whoever had gotten into my account.  
Now, because of this, much of my games library is no longer available to play on my PS4, and because Sony only allows for 1 console deactivation every 6 months, whoever got into my account either owns my games for 6 months, or they are now locked in the ether.

I talked to Sony support on this, and they basically told me to get over it. Apparently, they just don't have the ability to reinstate my account's deactivation use, nor can they deactivate it themselves.

I understand it can be a fun challenge so is that mainly it for you?  If a platinum trophy is within reach to the point where it will still be fun to get I'll go for it.  However if I have to play an entire game again on a harder difficulty or something I just don't want to taint my love for a game I just enjoyed playing through by going through it again like a chore just to get a trophy.  The desire to get it does work it's way into your mind sometimes though.  Much love gamers, happy gaming.

I sent it off as that's covered by my insurance and they concluded it was fixed but...it's just not? When I got it back they had Infinite Warfare installed so clearly they tested a disc. 


It's odd, Risk of Rain 2 is absolutely the worst for no reason I can tell, it was completely fine for like a month and it's not scratched or anything but the PS4 struggles with it in particular.

Let me start from the beginning my ps4 controller started messing up it would allow me to open apps and games but I was unable to press “x” or any other  indication to start a game or watch a movie-show, so I hit the reset button on the back of my controller to see if this would help, now my controller won’t connect to the ps4 next I tried to troubleshoot  the ps4 and this did nothing I have checked all cords and was still at a loss I bought new usb cords to connect my with my controller but nothing worked. I’ve watched countless YouTube videos but none of the tips seemed to do anything. When my controller stared to flash yellow when I plugged it in to the ps4 I thought my controller had died and I was sad 😢 but then I tried to pair it with my phone and it worked but for some reason it won’t pair with the ps4. So I guess what I’m asking is how do I pair my controller to my ps4? 

- Thanks for any help I get! 😊",PS4,1

Sometimes the audio cuts in cinematics and sometimes that noise from the video shows up, in Miles Morales also happened but not this loud. The console is brand new, not even 5 months old. Do i have to factory reset it or maybe it´s a deeper problem and I have to use the warranty on this? Also in the menus the navigation sounds are odd but only when I use headphones and put the volume a bit higher than usual. I also tried different headsets but you can hear the noise in the video even on the tv speaker. I just want to know if someone have had this same issue.

Well, I guess I found the reason. Found dead ants in the power supply area of the console while wiping it down and looking around. I wouldn't say a lot of dead ants but I'd say enough to be causing some annoying problems. Ants got on my table and underneath the console a while back but I cleaned up as soon as I noticed, and never really had problems with the console until all these went down so I never knew that it/they got to this point. Pretty bummed out. Console still works perfectly fine apart from the console dying a few seconds after powering up every few days.

"What's really wrong with my PS4? I posted yesterday about this issue, so this is kind of and update to provide more details: I bought a Seagate 2TB external drive to expand my storage capacity. Everything has been working alright with it, except that I accidentally unplugged my PS4 from the wall a couple of times without shutting it down, and I know this is bad for the external drives. Last time this happened was like a month ago, and now I've been experiencing the CE-34224-5 error with two disc games which are installed on said HDD. I thought it was the hard drive's fault, so I replaced it with another one (it's the same exact model thought, it's just a brand new one I had laying around) and I keep getting the same error message.

However, it's very confusing because I installed a fully online game in the ""faulty"" HDD and I get no errors whatsoever. So I thought the disc reader was responsible. I proceeded to insert a disc from a game that was installed in the PS4's internal HDD, but I got no errors, so I don't think the disc reader or the PS4 itself have any issues. And it shouldn't, because this PS4 is only a year old (bought it brand new) and I don't have issues with extreme dust or anything like that, although I must say I have never cleaned my console during all this time.

My theories are:

1. The external HDD manufacturer is so bad that both drives are faulty, and that's why I keep getting the error

2. The save games of the games I'm trying to play simply became corrupted, and I must start all over again

"No party chat audio through headset? So, I'm looking to see if anyone can help me with some issues I'm having, it's sort of a combination of two issues and if I could get a solution for either one it would seriously help me out.

The first issue is with audio headsets and a semi-broken vr headset.  A friend gave me a full vr set for my ps4.  When I got it hooked up, it looks like the back half of the headset isn't getting any power as the rear tracking lights won't come on and plugging anything into the headphone jack does nothing.  It never detects that anything is hooked up and I never get any audio at all, not even static.  That by itself isn't too much of a problem, the vr headset and tracking through the camera still work fine actually, the lights being out seems to have basically no effect.  However, when I try to plug my headset into the player one controller it just says I can't use the audio device while I'm using the vr headset.  Super fucking annoying, I'm really hoping that there's a workaround for that.  If there's a way to force it to use the player one controller audio while using vr I'd appreciate someone cluing me in.  I've done quite a bit of looking around and I haven't been able to find a solution so I'm guessing there probably isn't one, but it would be nice if I was wrong lol.

The second issue comes from my initial workaround.  I figured out that if I plugged the headset into a second controller it would work fine, game and party audio came through no problem.  That worked for about 3 days then all of a sudden party chat stopped coming through.  We were playing a game at the time, I hadn't touched any settings and as far as I can tell nothing happened that should have caused this to happen.  Game audio never had an issue, party audio just stopped working entirely in the middle of a gaming session.  The other people in the party can still hear me and as best I can tell my voice is still coming through the headset mic and not the vr headset or camera mic, the other party members said that my voice quality did not change at all when this happened.  I've triple checked all of my settings, it's set to all audio, prioritize party audio etc. Switching to tv speakers the party chat comes through fine, if I turn off the vr and plug back into the main controller it still works fine there.  I've tried swapping the controllers thinking that the second controller, which is already pretty broken, might have stopped working somehow but it still does the same thing either way.  I've seen that this is apparently a common issue with the sony gold wireless headsets, but I'm running a steelseries Arctis1 wired headset.  Another odd part is that a couple of times the problem has flipped, my mic stopped working but party audio started coming through again.  I haven't been able to replicate that though so I have no idea what causes it to do that.  99% of the time it's no chat audio with the mic working though.  If anyone knows at least how to get that working again that would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR
Is there a way to force a headset plugged into the controller to work while using vr, or alternately is there a way to fix an issue with party chat not coming through the headset even with all of the obvious settings in the correct configuration?",PS4,1

"[Base PS4] Help deciding between SSD or SSHD Hi All,

So I don’t plan on getting a PS5 until the next incarnation and was thinking about throwing a SSD or a SSHD into my Base PS4 (CUH-1215a). I only keep 1-3 games loaded at a time, so I don’t care as much about storage space as I do speed. Because of that, it seems to make sense to get a 500gb SSD (Samsung 860 Evo) over a 1TB SSHD (Seagate Firecuda) for what is basically the same price right now ($55-$60 on Black Friday).

I’ve looked at a bunch of reviews and people seem to have mixed opinions on what’s ideal. If anyone who has experience with these drives could offer their insights, I was wondering:

* How effective is the Firecuda caching and how close would you say it gets to the performance of the SSD once things are cached? Again storage is not an issue, but if I’m getting say 90% of the SSD performance with the Firecuda, I’ll take the extra 500gb for a 10% speed sacrifice.
* If you’re of the opinion that a SSD is significantly better than a SSHD for base PS4, why so? I’ve read that the base PS4 bottlenecks the SSD since it’s only a Sata II, but I’m not sure what the point of overkill is and how much under that point the Firecuda is.
* If you like something better for load times and Home Screen speed for a similar price, what is it and why do you like it over these options?
* Also if you upgraded to either but weren’t able to notice any difference then let me know that as well. I’ve had this thing for 4 years and only recently have been noticing a slowdown. Either because I’ve been playing more PC and that NVME is just way faster by comparison or maybe games are just more demanding on the system now.

If it matters, the types of games I mostly play are NBA 2K, UFC, and the AAA PS exclusives (Last of Us Part II, God of War, Uncharted, etc.). No FPS/Battle Royale games or anything like that.

Any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",PS4,1

All inputs for the PS4 (in menu, for playing DVDs, etc) work flawlessly. However, when I load up FIFA 21, it takes about 20 seconds per button input. If I hit multiple buttons, it’s not like it does it all at once and freaks out at 20 seconds later, but it’s more like it doesn’t think I’ve input anything but I’ll allowed to do one input (ie, tab over to the “play” section) before I have to wait another 20 seconds for the next input. 

Unfortunately, I just got this PS4 and FIFA is the first and only game I have yet.

Another example is something like the DBZ Karakot game, which has some Day One Edition bonuses. If I get the Deluxe Edition of a Digital copy of it, and it still doesn't come with the Day One Bonuses, will those transfer over since I have them on Physical?

I took it to a local repair shop and got the power supply issue fixed, but when we got the system back home, any disc that he put in wouldn't read. The PS4 says ""Unrecognized Disc"". My nephew thinks that he may have turned the screwdriver the wrong way when he tried to eject the disc, and after doing it the right way he thinks he turned the screwdriver clockwise to try to ""reset"" the disc drive. I was wondering if anyone here has heard of this sort of thing messing up the disc drive, and if anyone can think of possible fixes for it.

"Create a new PSN account? Maybe? Alright, so without a doubt this will prob be the most asinine post you will ever read.

I have had my PSN account for quite a while at this point. And just recently I started trophy hunting. I contacted support a few times (5) over the past 3 years about misc things. Just missing promo emails, website issue, couple of trophy questions like deleting games/hiding them, etc.

All of them pretty much were less than a total of 30 minutes combined.

Alright.... so here comes the more stupid part. I have anxiety and recently have started having panic attacks. And I don’t know why having previous contacts (even for easy Q&amp;A) under my account with support bothers me. But it just does...to the point where I get panic attacks.

I don’t want to start another account and loose years of games, save progress, trophies, etc. But I don’t know how to get rid of this anxiety over my account. Maybe starting a new fresh account will help, but maybe it won’t. Plus I don’t really want to give up years of games and progress and start over. So I don’t know how either option will turn out in the long run.

Not even sure what answer I am looking for. Maybe mostly seeing if someone else has experienced a similar feeling over something on their account.

"Push Scalpers Out Of Gaming As scalpers begin taking over the launch of new consoles and accessories we see an eerie similarity to the sneaker industry. However, unlike the sneaker industry, gaming is not necessarily a collector's market and we as a collective group can put pressure on the gaming industries to create ways to solve this problem.

I don't expect to get a next-gen console at retail price until year 2021 and I am fine with that if it means driving away these scalping industries. The difference between the sneaker industry and the gaming industry is that these game developers are making their games for the next-gen consoles and considering these consoles are not getting into the hands of actual gamers then the developers will eventually start running into problems selling product or be forced to continue developing for last-gen consoles. Hopefully game developers will put pressure on console makers by removing their exclusivity in order to sell more copies of their games unless more is done to get consoles into the hands of actual gamers.

It makes no difference to the Walmarts and Best Buys of the world who actually buys the consoles because they just see a unit being sold and are not reliant upon these sales. This is why we must put the pressure further up the chain to make a change.

These scalpers are relying on the fact that people will pay whatever it takes to get a console for the holidays. Please make a stand in solidarity to not purchase next-gen consoles or accessories from 3rd party sellers for inflated prices even if it means not getting a new console this holiday season. Otherwise, these scalpers will begin trying to take advantage of our industry and running it into the ground.

"[Rant] Horizon Zero Dawn PC port pricing Hello there,

There, I don't know if this the best place to post it but since we are talking about an ex-exclusive PS4 game, it looked like a good fit to me. I couldn't find a specific Sony Interactive Entertainment sub.  


I was very excited when I heard Sony was probing the PC market with Death Stranding and Horizon (I don't own a PS for various reasons out of the scope of this topic)  


But my disappointment was and is still strong. The pricing is totally off. I didn't buy it initially because too expensive and 4 months later, black friday and check the prices of the Definitive edition  


GOG / Steam : 60 CAD  
EGS : 50 USD  
PS4: 30 CAD  


I understand there is the porting price and the cut of the selling platform. But GOG / Steam take 30% and EGS 12%. And I assume Sony didn't sign a custom better deal. If Sony wanted to keep the same margin as the PS4 (I wouldn't mind) the prices should  


GOG/Steam : 43 CAD  
EGS: 26 USD  


Sony already amortized the cost of development during the 3.5 years of exclusivity on PS4. So selling it at the fair price of 43CAD would cover the port and give a margin.  


I am extremely disappointed. Well my money, my mind and and my time were ready for you Sony but they will go instead in the pocket of another game publisher. We are in a world where there is more games than available leisure time. You can't screw up like that and screw us like that. Being bought and played is a privilege. Don't be greedy, be fair.

"PS4 Slim not ejecting disk, gets stuck, HELP! So, a few weeks back I cleaned my PS4 Slim as it was getting pretty dusty, doing that I damaged a sensor for the disk drive making it so that disks would not be accepted or read, to the point where you had to physically jam it in. So I had to replace it which I did, now it inserts automatically, reads it and all is well, but now when I try to eject the disc it does the beeping sound, does a little clicking noise like trying to eject the disk, but ultimately it gets stuck in there and doesn’t do anything. Now after trying to figure out the problem, when we put the disc in it sometimes grinds, or the disc just smudges. I suspect it’s that white thing to the left side of the disc drive (As shown in [This link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1441/7454/files/PS4-Disc-Drive-Repair_medium.jpg?v=1491944027)not mine, as that’s the thing that gets stuck, where I have to use a tool to get it unstuck.

"looking for game recommendations (older ps4-noob) I haven't seriously gamed since N64 (favs: mario64, kart64, goldeneye), PS1 (tekken, wipEout, gta2) and late-90s-PC (simcity2k, Unreal Tournament, Counterstrike), only some casual gaming. I bought a PS4 a couple of weeks ago and I am looking for recommendations as to which games are worth getting.

My experience so far:

* Hitman: loved watching on YouTube, levels are very beautiful, but gameplay is fiddly...
* GTA5: this alone was worth the ps4, played through without really stopping, 10/10
* Red Dead 2: it's beautiful, technically impressive, but the theme fails to interest me
* Spider-Man: nyc looks great, fighting good (but quite complex), pipemania puzzles turned me off
* wipEout Omega: Great fun, feels like the old games, much nostalgia
* Tekken 7: Not so great, here nostalgia fails to kick in. Meh...
* Super Meat Boy: Love it! control precision makes the endless retries worth it.
* Doom 2016: in CS i was a defensive player, so always-attack-style challenged me. I think I like it.

So, if you have some recommendations for me, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

Not particularly a fan/seeker of anime style games, but don’t mind them if they are good. Example of anime style games I really liked are valkyria chronicles remastered and valkyria chronicles 4.

How important is dialogue? I assume there is a ton of it in persona 5. I most often skip through dialogue, unless important.

The game doesn’t look good graphically.

"PS4 crashes in certain points of some games? So I was playing AC Valhalla and when I reached a certain point in the story, I got an error message that reads: ""Cannot continue using this application. The data is corrupted, delete the application from the PS4 , and then download it again"" and then it asks me to eject the disc. I got no other error messages or anything. Since it's a new game I thought it was some kind of bug that was going to be patched, but then I started playing Detroit: Become Human and the same thing happened, I reached a certain point in the game and I received the same error message. I tried rebuilding my database, making sure the discs were not damaged, restarting the PS4, updating the system, but nothing worked. One thing these games have in common though, is that they are both installed in the external hard drive that I use, and I mistakenly have disconnected it from the PS4 while it was still on a couple of times, although the last time it happened was probably over a month ago. Could this be the cause of the issue? Should I try formatting my external hard drive to see if this helps? Thanks in advance",PS4,1

So I used to own the physical copy of the game ""Dreams"" but then I decided to give it to my friend and I will get the digital copy as I like digital more because I don't want to keep switching disks, I made the purchase from PS App and no matter how many times I click ""download to console"" nothing happen, my PS4 is the primary and I tried to download from the PSN too but I don't have the option to download, all I get is ""start"" and it will start from disk,  I also can't find it in my library.

PS4 slim or PS4 Pro So how the title says I want to buy a PS4 and still dont know which one. First I read some tips online and I was pretty sure that the PS4 slim is enough for me. But after talking to my friends I'm again unsure. They said that the PS4 slim is really slow and tried to convince me to the Pro. Then I though I would ask you as community to tell me the truth which one would be better. I guess I will never be hardcore playing because I don't have so much time I just want to play bit at evening at home. I have never had a PS so I guess even the PS4 slim will be amazing for me (my friends had all generations so I guess that's why they see so much difference). Can you please help me? My TV is not 4k and I guess not even UHD because I read the Pro version is mostly chosen because of the quality on the TV. Thank you really much for every answer!,PS4,1

"Play of the Past #2 | Until Dawn [Game Discussion Thread] Last Tuesday, you have voted for the PS4 classic you wanted to discuss. This time, a game quickly came on top and wasn't dethroned at all even after a slightly extended voting period. And I don't know why, but the word ""dawn"" seems to be pretty popular in these voting threads.

https://preview.redd.it/syvij72une161.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3356c0ad349233c6e78a27f86a903714e93a9cc8

After developing party-based games for the PS3, Supermassive Games began working on a horror project named **Until Dawn**, which was originally due to release in 2012 on PS3 and had to be played with the Move controllers. Then it radically changed towards a more traditional horror game, with a new focus inspired with games like Heavy Rain where your choices can impact the story.

Until Dawn was a commercial success, surpassing Sony's expectations, but also a critical one. Even if the game had some issues with a choppy framerate and a third act perceived as disappointing, its ambiance and concept managed to catch both hardcore and casual gamers. And despite being single-player, Until Dawn was also really popular with friends when passing the controller to another player at each chapter.

If it spawned a VR shooter spin-off with Rush of Blood, no proper sequel to Until Dawn was produced. Supermassive Games went on to develop their own IP with spiritual successors to Until Dawn: **The Dark Pictures Anthology. T**wo titles have been released so far: Man of Medan in 2019, followed by Little Hope that released only a few weeks ago.

"Lag problem with Yakuza 7 Hi there, everyone, I hope you can help me.

I’ve started playing Yakuza Like a Dragon, and I noticed some serious lag. I haven’t played much, so there will be no spoilers whatsoever.

First, when changing from the first cutscene to the first actual playtrough of the game, it freezed for a couple of seconds, but I didn’t mind it much. However, as soon as I started playing, I noticed an input lag of roughly one second. The input lag does not happen on other games like Disgaea 5 or in the home menu.

Also, the graphics are… wobbly? I don’t know how to explain, you feel everything is stiff while moving.

I had the same problem with God of War, but I fixed it somehow. I retried it, and there is a sliiiight lag, maybe intended. Anyway, it doesn’t affect the gameplay much. 

About the specifics of console and tv:

The ps4 is a ps4 pro Kingdom Hearts 3 edition. HDR is enabled. I tried to switch it off, just to be sure, but the lag remains.

The tv is a Hisense H55U7BE. It doesn’t have a game mode. I tried to switch off the boosted HDMI option, which enables 4k gaming, but it didn’t affect the lag of Yakuza.

A friend of mine has a PS4 Pro with the game and it doesn’t lag at all.

The only thing I can think of, is that that GoW is digital, while Yakuza is physical.

Thank you all.",PS4,1

"AC Valhalla feels like a massive step back from Odyssey. As someone who really got into the franchise of Assassin's Creed after playing Origins, and also as someone who considers Odyssey one of my favorite games of last generation, Valhalla just ain't cutting it man. 

This game seems like it is a definite step back from those last two titles. The biggest flaws for me personally are the fact that combat is not as exciting or loose in this game and that exploration is not as interesting either. The structure for the story is incredibly boring compared to Odyssey as well. 

All you do in this game is go to a settlement or town and meet a few uninteresting and easily forgettable characters and then perform some boring ass quests for them before it all culminates in a one final battle with some of the worst assassination cutscenes I've seen from this series yet.

The game feels often like a wanna be Witcher 3 knock off, sans the magical and fantasy elements of that game, for the most part. 

Then there is the loot system in this game. Its basically non-existent when compared to the last two games. I get that Odyssey had too much loot, but at least there was some exciting stuff once in a while in that game. We can't even have one handed swords in this fucking game. 

In any case, this game feels so disappointing when compared to Odyssey and I would recommend to any fans of that game to wait for a sale because this is not worth full price. Maybe just wait to see how Immortals sounds and looks because that may be a better purchase. 

I really hope the series takes a break for at least two years this time and works on a better story and better mission design and combat. This series needs a break but it clearly sold like gangbusters and seems to be getting a lot of positive reviews to my surprise. Just play Ghost of Tsushima instead.",PS4,1

Recently we have not been able to talk to each other because her mic will cut out and all I can hear is her console. It's very clear, as if it were being streamed as the input?? It's not just feedback from the headset because I can't hear her at all when this happens. She's tried different controllers and nothing seems to work.

Basically I just want a game with intense car racing (doesn't need to be a lifelike simulator, I'm looking to get over the top with my racing) and very in depth car customization and a general cool looking open world to roam around in.

"Refurbished PS4? So my PS4 Slim broke down this weekend, it was a gift from my girlfriend who paid full price ($399 + tax) at Best Buy on March 2019. Now, I work and have a life so by no means do I ever over use the thing, some weeks I don’t even turn it on for days at a time. After it broke down, I had the error of it getting stuck in safe mode and then wouldn’t make it Past, saying something like “checking memory drive.” I ended up doing a hard reset and then it would do the same check up, but this time it started successfully taking me to the Home Screen, however, there were no fan noises coming from the system, it sounded very still and quiet as if the power source was the only thing working in there. It downloaded apps just fine and I could go online up to this point, however it would not open any app, or game for operations. I decided then, to open up the system and upon doing so, I discovered that a good amount of the crews holding the metal plate down aren’t factory issues, in fact, they don’t even seem to be screws at all, since they have a rounded head much like that of a nail, while the rest are regular x-heads and standard TR8 security heads. Now, I looked up almost every PS4 slim cleaning procedure on YouTube and all of them were able to successfully remove all the screws holding the metal plate with either the x-head or the TR8 security head, so what I’m thinking is that Best Buy sold my girlfriend a refurbished PS4 at full price? 
At this point I took the system to my trusted electronics specialist and he was very quick to diagnose a bad Hard Drive, while I was thinking it was just a fan issue. Keep in mind, I’ve owned the system for less than 2 years and I don’t play religiously, how should I proceed? What do you all recommend In this situation? Thank you in advance for taking time to read through this, I’ve no hair left to pull from my head so any helpful input is appreciated",PS4,1

"Battlefield 6 Hello friends, how are you all?

I'm an old player in the BF series, I started in the first game of the franchise and I would like to bring some ideas that I believe are good for BF6.

It's just my opinion, you can add or modify, let's try to create a concept of what we believe would look good in the next game.

Battlefield 6

Multiplayer

\* 100 - 150 players 50X50 - 75×75

\* Domination - Points are added with kill and objectives

(New progression)

\* Return of levolution + dynamic climate (day / night, snow, rain)

Equipment: Sub-machine guns + C4 + Hooks + abseiling rope

uniform / skins - infiltration + night + diving

Perks: Silent steps + silent finishing

Perk: Camouflage + Spot sight

Your points are earned using commands with the squad leaders and tactical support for the team.  
The commander walks back through the game as well as in battlefield 2.  
Bombing - missiles - napal - Artillery- hacker attack  
Battleroyale

LLevolution multiplayer  
Map.  
Large with forests, city, port, several houses and buildings.

All destructive map with frostbite + climate changes - (day and night) Rain - snowstorm

 All of this with levolution events - Great falls of buildings, floods, avalanches.  
  (Most provoked by players.)  
Day and night affect visibility.

(release night equipment and heat)  
Buildings, shops, houses - All this is exploitable and destructive.  
Levolution - falls from buildings - houses - earthquakes - avalanches - floods.

Each game will be different and the game more dynamic.  
Weapons and vehicles scattered across the map.  
Cars - motorcycles - helicopters - jet ski - speedboats - tanks  
missions earn B.P - Battle Points  
Battle points buy weapons - Vehicles - relive time - Vests - predefined kits  
By killing enemies you gain the B.P he had.  
B.P buy Bombing-artillery - tomawhank  
(Bombings destroy the scene)  
Everything is destructive  
Characters  
All characters from the story mode of previous and unpublished games  
  (did someone call dun's wife?).  
Battle pass  
Important to keep the game alive with new content and without having to sell DLC.  
New characters - Weapons - Skins - Vehicles - Personal cards  
Gameplay mechanics  
Characters don't hang on the curb. (Seriously)  
They lift their feet and legs naturally.  
Climbing mechanics  
Medium walls - fences - easy alone 

To reach higher places, the player can hold an action button, thereby pushing the other player up.  
The top player can hold the action button and pull the bottom player.  
Please make sure the soldiers are soldiers and don't get stuck like those in COD who don't jump over a small wall and look like lego toys.  
Mechanics of dragging the companion.  
Mechanics of reviving companion in BR.  
When a soldier is knocked down he has time to be healed, when the time is zero or another player attacks him on the ground he dies and his items stay on the ground and his B.P goes to whoever killed him.

Your companions can buy a syringe to relive that companion in one of the several vending machines on the map, but it needs to be injected into your body and right there it comes back to life.

He doesn't come back on the plane.  
My question is whether someone can or should be revived more than once or perhaps include a luck factor.  
Example: The player died a second time and when injecting the syringe he has a chance of being revived or having an overdose indicating that it is not possible for him to return.  
Loot  
Weapons, armor, ammunition, thermal and night vision goggles, gas mask, drones, shields, hacker tools, climbing hooks, landmines and anti-soldier, various grenades.  
Finishing from behind and on lying and downed enemies.  
Progression  
Progression is very important.  
I love filling XP bars and points and looking forward to releasing new things in the game.

I thought of the progression as follows:  
Upon completing missions you gain quest xp and have a progression window and items.  
When making kills you get another type of xp that will release another progression window with other items.

It is possible to win both at the same time in matches, even the most camper of the camper needs to move if he wants to unlock everything in the game.  
Each different progression whether by missions or kills will unlock characters, weapons, skins ...  
but they will be different items in each of the two progressions.  
These are some ideas that I believe would be interesting for the game.  
Give your opinion and let's talk.  
I believe that the next game is going to be great, regarding graphics there is no denying that the dice is overcome with each game.  
I really want to see this added to interesting new gameplay mechanics in multiplayer and a BR.  
One tip is that if possible, who only wants the MP without the BR that is possible to download separately.  
The same for those who want only the BR.  
And a great campaign that when you finish it you unlock characters for MP and BR.

"Upgrading from Slim-Pro. How do I move Games on External Hard Drive without losing them? Sorry in advance if this is a complete noob question but I seem to be seeing different answers or slightly different scenarios to mine when I've tried to look. 

Basically I had a PS4 Slim with all my games backed up on a 4TB Hard Drive which is pretty full. I've just bought a Pro which I'm about to set up and wondering how to transfer the games over in the easiest way without losing them. I've got nearly 3TB of games so want to be sure I don't do anything to lose them whilst setting up on the new Pro.

I've heard of people using the backup and restore method onto their HD but I've already transferred my games over to the HD so not sure if this is a seperate method. 

I have an Ethernet cable as well as I've heard this is the best way to transfer App Data, Captures etc (as those apparently can't be transferred onto a HD)

The reason I have ps4 is gt sport, but with the ps5 release I'm scared about the idea of this game dying. I know gt7 is coming out next year and I believe the player base will go to the new game.

The thing is that I like gt sport in ps4 (also my friend has ps4, so I can play with him) but I don't wanna wait too much till the price drops so much in the second hand market. Right now I can sell it for the same price I paid weeks ago (yeah, I bought a second hand ps4).

If I have only ps4, I would clearly keep my ps4, but having a pc where I can play racing games... But gt sport online is so much fun.

"Expectations for Empire of Sin While browsing the ps4 store the other day, I watched a trailer for a game called Empire of Sin. It is a strategy game set in Prohibition-era Chicago, with an emphasis on mobsters and bootlegging. 

I am writing this post to see if people are aware of this game, and if so, to see what your expectations are. I had never heard of it before seeing it on the store. It is from a small studio that I'm unfamiliar with (Romero Games) and is being published by Paradox. It releases December 1st.

I don't know a lot about the game, but it seems to consist of both top-level strategy where you try to expand your territory against rival gangs to control neighborhoods (think Civilization or something) and tactics-based combat (think XCOM).

You do things like make and sell bootleg alcohol, recruit gangsters to join your squad, (I think) open businesses to recruit crowds to your speakeasies, create alliances or rivalries with competing crime bosses, etc.

There seems to be a high level of depth in many parts of the game. For example, gangsters you recruit have things like loyalty and perks, and they can get along with or feud with other gangsters in your crew, influencing your posse's overall capabilities. Their abilities seem RPG-like. As in XCOM, if they die during the game, they are gone for good. There are apparently many weapons to equip your squad with, and many ways of expanding your territory (diplomacy, turf wars, etc).

Here is a trailer:

https://youtube.com/watch?v=CzUtt8UvlyU

"Only disconnecting on certain games? So this is a relatively new issue I’ve been having as of late where I disconnect from online sessions but only on certain games. The main three that I’ve been testing this with has been Overwatch, Monster Hunter World Iceborne, and Apex Legends. 
Monster Hunter works just fine, with an occasional hiccup here and there, but it has solid connections 99% of the time. 
Most of the time I can’t even load in to Apex, and if I can I can’t even stay on for long before getting kicked from any session, with myself or my friends.
Now the same problem is happening while I play overwatch, I have trouble just loading in and I  can’t stay in a group with my friends for more than a couple seconds before getting booted.
 
Has anyone else had this issue with online multiplayer games? 

All softwares are up to date as of this writing and I use a LAN cable connection so you’d THINK I should be fine but that doesn’t seem to be the case.",PS4,1

"Dualshock 4 weird headphone issue - loud static and controller speakers active all ways Hay, I have 2 controllers (Blue camo and green camo), both of which are having this strange problem.

&amp;#x200B;

When I connect earphones, I get really loud, static noise, regardless of what the output volume is set from the PS4. And yes, I have routed all audio to earphones. The weird part is, with the earphones connected, the speaker in the controller also gives out sound (and isn't muted), which I'm sure isn't normal behaviour. This seems to happen even if earphones are not connected, the static is audible from the speakers too. My stock controller works perfectly fine, but the pretty controllers are having this issue. 

Is there anyway to fix this? I tried resetting the controllers (Pressing the reset button under the controller for 10 seconds) but it didn't seem to do anything. How do I fix this?",PS4,1

"Help with sharing add ons and meaning of restore licenses Hey guys, I was wondering if someone could help me, I have this problem: I want to share DLC's (Add ons) on a same PS4 but different accounts, because I purchased Civ 6 recently so my dad and I could play and we want to purchase the add ons and since we play on different accounts we dont want to purchase it twice. I saw on a Ubisoft forum the next steps:

*""1 - Deactivate my wife's account as primary. (Not sure if this was necessary, but doesn't hurt unless you're using both to purchase content from PSN). 2 - Switched users to log in under my account (the account used to purchase the DLC on the PS3) and go to Settings -&gt; PSN -&gt; Restore Licenses. 3 - This removed the DLC's I had downloaded already in the game, so I went back into the store (via the Shop in Rocksmith 2014) and re-downloaded the songs I had previously purchased. (They showed as purchased, just needed to re-download them). 4 - I then quit the game after all DLC's had been installed and switched users back to my wife's account.

Upon loading the game again all the purchased DLC's were available to her. I switched back to my account just to verify it was on mine as well and everything is working as it should again.""*

So I did the step 1 Deactivating my Dad account as primary, but I don't know what restore licenses will do so I havent done the next step because I'm afraid if I'll have to re-purchase everything or if I'll lose progress or trophies. I know I will have to re download it but re purchasing it is a totally different thing. Please help guys.",PS4,1

"3.5mm 5.1 Speakers to ""Simulated Surround"" So, i had a 2.1 System running through my TV paired with the Sony Bravia ""Surround"" Sound with the Woofer built in the TV. Both were running at the same time and the sound was decent. The Speakers were really cheap, but they were better than just using the TV set, at least it had bass. Combined, they sounded nicely for what they were.  


Now since it was Black Friday, i bought a pair of these babies because i was short on budget, but they really striked the price down the middle, so i had to.  
It was around 100€ on sale, they usually go for 200€ or 150€ sometimes. I bought the last unit.  


[https://content.ekatalog.biz/katalog/216660123/PA\_SW-HF5.pdf](https://content.ekatalog.biz/katalog/216660123/PA_SW-HF5.pdf)  
Now they do not support Optical Audio of any kind, only 5.1 DVD 6x Jacks, and 2x 3.5mm for Music/TV and a separate jack beneath it for Gaming. Mind, this is using the 3.5mm cable. Now from what i understand, the system is using Stereo Sources and mixing them with the Rear Channels for a ""Surround"" sound when using gaming (Haven't tried TV yet). And it's working rather well. Sounds that are coming from behind, come from behind, both left and right, central is working and can be used for voices or just as a central, and Left and Right do their job. I can also + and - any of the speakers to sound louder or quieter. Thing is, it says it supports Dolby and DTS. PS4 has PCM Linear, Bitstream Dolby and Bitstream DTS. PCM Linear, from what i know is raw audio, no compression, it sends the signal right like it is. Others are processed, but the AUX does the rest.  


However my main question is, would i benefit from Dolby or DTS Surround while just using a 3.5mm Jacket with the AMP doing the scaling to create a more ""Surround"" sound? Dynamic Range is quite good on them, and i can usually set them to max or near max. Especially when using my Headphones too.  


I tested various games, but the best game to test was TLOU2. Obviously, it doesn't recognize the speakers as 5.1 since they are using Stereo. But the sound direction was simulated as 5.1.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a long time ago Dolby Pro Logic II could convert Stereo Signal into 5.1, or if the game was encoded with it, it would produce a proper 5.1 signal. I even have an old Home Cinema that i use for my PC and i can just use Dolby Pro Logic II to upscale the signal from Stereo.  


So is there any benefit for me using Dolby or DTS over PCM? Or is there any other solution that is cheap? Mind you, i also want to use those speakers for regular TV and PS3, and PS5 in the near future. I got some kind of plug that goes into the Stereo Socket of the TV for Optical i think. It's just a piece of plastic from what i can figure. But still. Should i even bother, or should i just stick with PCM?I mean, since it says on the box it supports Dolby and DTS, there must be some benefit to it, or?  


I also tested some other games like DMC4:SE, DMCV, etc. I should also test Sekiro and Ghost of Tsushima along with REmake2 and 3, maybe even Bloodborne.

"Microphone suddenly stopped working. Hi there!

For some reason my PS4 doesn't get my microphone audio anymore, it does let me change the 'Input Volume' but there is no Input at all. I have tried 3 different controllers, unfortunately I do not have another mic to test it with. The weird part is that the microphone works fine on my MacBook, haven't tried my phone yet.

"Sorry to the kids and parents of this holiday season I remember being a kid and seeing the N64 in the Toys R Us big book and hoping to everything that I'd be able to get one under the Christmas tree that year. I bugged the ever living shit out of my parents asking if I could get one, and repeatedly was told ""maybe santa will bring one"". That Christmas morning when I unwrapped the console that shaped my youth is a morning I'll never forget (especially since it's saved on VHS tape).

I feel bad for all the parents who are trying their asses off to get their kid one of the new consoles (whether PS or Xbox) and are getting the shaft from people buying them up left and right to scalp at absolutely absurd prices. $800 dollars for a new console? These are parents working to make ends meet in a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and trying to give their kids a nice Christmas, and the going rate of the new systems is DOUBLE the retail value. 

I also feel bad for the kids asking for a new console. These scalpers are actively fucking over the parents, and while the parents get the brunt of it, the kids are the ones who don't even get the chance at a new system because people sit on the releases like hawks to make a quick buck on the secondary market. So the parents feel like shit because they can't afford the jacked up console prices, and the kids feel like shit because they can't get the hot item of the season. 

Maybe I'm being an ""old man"" about this, but when I was younger there was no secondary market unless you went to the flea market and took a chance on some guy selling consoles out of his trunk. Now these people gobble up all the available consoles to flip them to desperate parents who want to make their kids happy. It was an excitement that I look back on fondly, and now seeing PS5s sell for $800+ I can't help but feel for the people getting absolutely raked over the coals.

"Game recommendations Hi! I’m currently in a position where I just can’t find a new suitable game for me. So I’m looking for some recommendations!

I like mostly RPGs, but the specific genre doesn’t really matter. I enjoyed action-based RPGs like RDR or Skyrim, JRPGs like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, or also casual games / Jump &amp; Run games like LittleBigPlanet or Super Mario.

What I’d prefer is a game you have to commit to. Not something you just play an hour a day but rather something that makes you dive into a well-built world or complex story and you don’t wanna stop playing. It doesn’t really matter if the game is linear or open world. If it includes battles I’d like to have a more complex battle / character development system, and not just something too simplistic like button mashing with the same sword throughout the whole game, etc

"Recommendations for a budget replacement PS4 HDD? 500GB is enough space for me I'm struggling to find recommendations online because most places are recommending for people looking to upgrade their HDD, while for me I'm just looking to replace a broken one.

For RPM, I assume I'm looking for 7200?  If I get one that is 5400 RPM, will I notice a large difference?

I guess my other question is whether or not its' even worth it to look for one smaller than 1 TB?  Just as an example, right now on Amazon.ca the Seagate Barracude 1TB is cheaper than the 500GB, and it looks like they don't even make the 500GB anymore.

"Intermittent PS4 issues - any pointers? Hi there - not sure if this is a known issue, but I was hoping to get some some pointers/advice. My OG PS4 is becoming intermittently unusable every couple of days. 

It works fine about 80% of the time... but every few days it starts doing the following all at once: 

- Unable to connect to network (NW-31295-0) over wifi. All other devices work just fine, and the PS4 is within 3 meters of the router. It works when connected via Ethernet. Updating system software or going via safe mode does not address the issue.

- Attempting to switch the console on from a controller stops the console working at all until it’s unplugged from the wall. None of the buttons (power, disc drive) do anything while the console is in this state. The controller lights up in white (and is clearly connected to the console, as it stays lit up and only switches off when the console is unplugged from the wall) but it never changes to the dark blue indicating ‘player 1’. 

- Disconnecting and reconnecting power allows the console to power on again (by using the power button, not a controller) but the issue will just immediately happen again next time the console is put to sleep or turned off. Router reboots do not help. However, waiting a few hours and just trying again later seems to fix the issue most of the time. 

These issues always happen at exactly the same time - it’s never just one of them at once.

I have a PS4 (normal one), since 2016 and recently, just a few weeks ago, it started not reading the CDs. Not just games, even DVDs. The ""Unrecognized CD"" thing, along with strange noises from the console and eventually the ejection of the CD.

The problem has come again and I'm a bit worried. I've watched a few videos and the general advice was to restart the console, go to the Safe Mode and check for updates (I haven't done it yet, but I'm still asking if there are other ways to solve this problem). 

What should I do? Is it an issue of the software or is it mechanical? If it's mechanical, what to do? I'm not enough brave to open the PS4 and repair manually a possible damage myself.

"Sharing online gaming audio with someone in the same room First off, apologies if I'm not going to explain this very well.

I've just got a PS4 and have been playing Red Dead Redemption online with a friend. My son likes to watch us play, but up till now I've been communicating with my friend using a phone on speaker so that my son can hear us. Obviously it's not going to work using a headset when there's someone in the same room as me. 

Is there a better way to do this? Can I get headsets for me and my son and use a splitter? If we did this, would my online friend be able to hear us both? 

Hope that makes sense!",PS4,1
"Ps4 update 8.01 issue Hi guys, I have a problem with my ps4 pro since the update from last Thursday.

I installed it on Friday and since then my ps4 just shuts down randomly.

There comes a multicolored screen vor a second and than it shutdown completely. If you turn it back on it has to recover the system and it says the warning you get when you just pull the plug. ""always shutdown your ps4 correctly etc."" 

On Friday it happened twice and I thought something is wrong with the electricity plug in the wall. So I changed it. Than it worked for a few hours.

In the evening it also worked fine.

Saturday morning I opened pes21 and everything seemed fine. But when I tried to start a coop match it happened again.

It than happened every time I just wanted to start the pes21 app or the cod app.

After 5 times of trying the ps4 didn't turn on anymore. I took it of the electricity and waited a couple of hours.

I could then start the save mode and reinstalled the update via save mode. But I didn't try to play anymore. 

On Sunday I tried again to play warzone, I managed to start the app and also a game. After maybe 10 to 15 min it happened again mid game.

So next I changed the hard-drive yesterday, because I thought maybe the hard drive is broken. The result ist no different. As soon as I start a game it shuts down.

I can go in the psn store, I can set up the settings, I can make a back up, I see my friends. But I can't play.

Anyone with a solid suggestion? Pretty frustrated right now.",PS4,1

"Changed fan and thermal paste but I think heatsink was the issue The last few years my ps4 has been the typical hairdryer/ jet aircraft, ps4, really really loud. Then at the beginning of my holidays from work that I specifically took to play ghost of tsushima. My fan starts making a grinding noise like drilling into metal. I researched and concluded the fan bearing had gone. I kept playing the console and was promptly met with a message I had never seen before but had heard of the "" ps4 is too hot and will now shut off"" blue screen. A little worried, I ordered a fan and some thermal paste for about £25. After taking the console to bits and reducing it to a piece of plastic I looked at the heatsink and discovered something just as bad as a bad fan. The heatsink was blocked on one side by 7 years worth of dust. I dont care how clean your apartment is or how much you dust your console or clean it out, until you get that heatsink of and check it's not blocked then you will be having an overworked fan like me. No wonder the console was noisy and loud. The fan was in overdrive trying to keep the cpu cool with a heatsink that only half worked properly. If I had cleaned the heatsink years ago when the noise get worse I bet my fan would have last longer or even still been ok. It now runs quiet and cool and like brand new basically. I'm impressed.

So my point is, that noise that loud ps4 you have. It might be a blocked heatsink you have.",PS4,1
"People who did not get the DS4 back button attachment. Are you getting one now? I have held off from buying the dualshock back button attachment for so long.

Then the PS5 hype started and I thought I would get one on the launch date. Welp, now I have come to accept the reality that I won't be getting PS5 until probably 2021.

"Play of the Past: vote for the PS4 classic you want to discuss! [Game Thread Voting] (November 24 2020) https://preview.redd.it/jchycohooay51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7fdbcf8ae33f632f4ab5de834e5b6594c28ebe3

Hi everyone,

There has been changes to how Game Discussion Threads are now handled. Now, **every major release will automatically have its own Discussion Thread**, and it will be the same for the **PlayStation Plus monthly games**.

As the PS5 is now here, it's now time to look back and discuss what made the great days of the PS4. As such, the Game Voting Thread will now be about **older games** (hence the name **Play of the Past**). So the latest big release will no longer automatically win, because it will have its own thread anyway.

**How does it work?**

1. Reply to this post with a game you'd like to see have its own discussion thread stickied at the top of the subreddit this week.
2. Vote for other games in the comments you'd like to see as well.
3. The top game will be given a game thread this week.

**Rules:**

1. One game per top-level comment. It will otherwise be ignored.
2. The game must be released and available to play on PS4. **It has to be at least 1 year old.** Exceptions can be made for more recent games that didn't have a discussion thread.
3. Try to **avoid duplicates** as they tend to dilute the voting.  If the top two comments are the same game, it will still only get one thread for the week.
4. If a game was selected for the Play of the Past thread in the past year (365 days), it has to wait a year before being eligible again. If a game gets its thread on December 3, 2020, it can't have another Play of the Past thread until at least December 2, 2021.

To view all recent game threads, [**click here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/search?q=flair%3A%22game+discussion%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all).

"Sensitive right analog stick Hello, so i got a controller last night from facebook marketplace, and when i went to play black ops cold war i noticed that every time i tried to aim or turn around the right stick was way too sensitive. If i try to aim on a specific point it would jump past whatever my target is and if i tried to turn just a tiny bit i’d do a full 180. I did try tweaking my settings and deadzones but nothing worked.

"Missing media player app I have some movies and TV shows saved to a USB that I wanted to watch on my PS4 while I download some memory heavy games, but I can’t seem to find where to access them via my PS4. I can listen to music from the USB but no videos.

The media player app appears in the purchased menu on the PS Store but when I go to download, it says it’s unavailable.

Did Sony kill the application or has it been renamed? Or am I just being daft and somehow missed an option to access video content from a USB in the home menu?

"First time PS4 owner: third party controllers? Good evening fellow redditors! I have read all the rules of this sub and apologize in advance for the noobness.

 I have purchased a PS4 for my kids (and me too, I must admit) for Xmas. The last gaming console i owned was a PS2 and that was about 14 years ago so i am very much out of the loop, but having a lot of fun picking out a bunch of games for it. Now I need to purchase two or three more controllers for it and was curious about aftermarket, third party controllers as Sony branded controllers are quite expensive. I see a bunch available on Amazon, some even positive reviews (4+ stars). 

Are these worth it to save $20-30 per controller? If so, can you recommend a brand? They advertise the same features and capabilities of the Sony controllers but I'd like some real world advice on this from the community. Also, would they work on the Sony Dual Controller charging dock? Or is this just a ""buy once, cry once"" situation?

"{HELP} I'm not even really sure how to explain this, so if someone could read my post and recommend a better title, I'd appreciate it a lot.  Randomly my brother’s ps4 pro has been stuck in a cycle of only starting in safe mode, and asking for an update later than 7.5 or something, via a USB. this occurs after it checks the systems storage. I assume we had a power outage while it was updating, and something corrupted or damaged the hard drive. 

I got an error SU-42477-4

I went through high hell and water, trying to get the update, I used multiple flash drives, made sure to reformat every single one tediously to FAT32 or exFAT. After this not working and other avenues I’ve exhausted, I used option 6 on safe made to factory reset the ps4. 

Weirdly enough, some sites said factory resetting it would take 30 minutes-2 hours, but mine did so instantly. 

After the factory reset, was the 1st time I got to a blue start up screen. The ps4 was working fine, it seemed a bit slower. We started downloading fornite for him, it downloaded to where it’s partially downloaded but playable, and he clicked it, the screen got stuck and wouldn’t let you do anything or go to the playstation’s homescreen.  

So I powered off the ps4 by holding the power button for 8 seconds, then restarted it, it gave the message prompt saying it was turned off incorrectly, as if I had pulled the AC cord to it. It resumbed the update, I went to go into settings, but every white icon on the home screen that I clicked would just freeze, but note completely freeze the screen saver in the background was still moving, and everytime I pressed the PS home button, it would unfreeze, and it was only doing this with things like the Settings Icon, Profile, etc. And everytime I pressed the PS button it would instantly unfreeze itself and go back to working fine. 

Well I wanted to goto into the settings so I figured I would just let it load incase it was freezing, so I pressed the Icon and it froze in the same way it was doing so prior, with the screen saver still moving, and I just waited a couple of minutes, and then it just went black and the ps4 was a blinking white light, but nothing would show up on the T.V, I’m pretty sure I had to turn it off again by holding the power down for 8 seconds. 

Once again the screen prompted the turned off incorrectly message as if I had just pulled the AC power cord, and I checked the cords and all seemed to be fine. 

It then for half a second said rebuilding database on a blue screen which finished in about 1 second. 

Then it was working normally, the ICONs no longer froze the screen, I tested the internet connection, it went smoothly and it started updating fornite again, I just left it for now as I have stuff to do. 

Can someone explain what the hell is going on and how to proceed, why would it randomly go black, but the white light still be blinking, and why would it freeze only when clicking the home screen icons, and instantly unfreeze if i just press the home button again?",PS4,1

My question then is - did any of you buy and play through the entire game in PS4? Would you say it was a fulfilling experince you felt didn't lack all that much?

My PS4 Slim has been lagging really bad and makes a weird sound when I turn it on So I’ve had my slim for over 3 years now and ive never had any issues with it until now. For the past few months I’ve noticed a weird sound coming from the disc drive whenever I turn it on and recently I’ve noticed how slow everything is running. At first it was just the Home Screen that was slow so I changed my theme to a static one and deleted some games I wasn’t playing to have more space. But now I’ve noticed that all my games are super laggy and the speaking animations never sync up to the dialogue in any of my games. Plus load times are unbearable now.  Whenever I die in Assassins Creed Valhalla it takes a good 3 mins to load up again. This also goes for Dark Souls 3. It’s very frustrating. I’ve googled some solutions and I’ve rebuilt the database. It’s still lagging. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance!,PS4,1

"[Resolved] PSN Errors WS-37400-04 &amp; WS-37472-3 tl;dr: Do not have a **space** or **special characters** in either your WiFi name or your WiFi password.

\#####

I couldn't find a solution to this issue logging into PSN online, and I ended up spending hours on the phone with Sony, Verizon FiOS, and Google WiFi. I'm posting this in case it helps someone.

One day, upon changing nothing, I was unable to login to PSN - I could not login on my PS4 or on the PS App on my phone. My PS4 was connected to the internet via the WiFi, and it had an IP address, but could not login to PSN.  I got the error code: **WS-37400-04**. A google search for this error code was unhelpful, and the only advice I found was to ""wait"". According to [https://status.playstation.com/](https://status.playstation.com/) everything was working fine. I waited overnight, no luck. 

If I disconnected my phone from my WiFi, I was able to login to the PS App. If I connected my PS4 via ethernet instead of WiFi, I was able to login to PSN. Following instructions from Sony, I enabled Port Forwarding on my PS4, reconnected it to WiFi, and now I got a different error code: **WS-37472-3**. Sony blamed my ISP, and my ISP blamed my router. Upon troubleshooting with Google WiFi folks, I was informed that my WiFi name and/or WiFi password should not have a **space** or a **special character** in it. I found this to be unbelievable, but it indeed did fix my issue. Anyway, hope this helps someone in the future.",PS4,1

"I think my PS4 is breaking and I don’t know what to do So my ps4 (original model) was completely shut off when it beeped and spat out the disk that was inside of it. Then when I turned it back on I tried to put the disk on it wouldn’t let me and it felt like something was in the way. Also happening at the same time is a whirring sound happening every 10 seconds or so.

(The whirring part has happened to me before and I removed the little rubber piece on the bottom of the console under the disk trey and that seemed to stop it from doing that)

After letting it sit for like 5 min I tried it again and the disk went in and the sound didn’t seem to be happening, but I didn’t leave it on long. Should I be concerned?",PS4,1

"Two Step Authenticator Issue My account got hacked at 5am today. I changed my password as quickly as I could, but the hacker turned on two step authenticator before I changed it. So as of now I have no way of getting into my account.

I waited until this morning when live chat opened up, I explained the issue and they told me they could help me out after I answered a few questions regarding the account. I know I answered everything correctly however they told me something was wrong and they could not help. I repeated this process four more times and now they won’t let me back into live chat for the day.

I’ve had this account since about 2009, I’m trying to think of what could possibly be wrong about the security questions. One of them was “Give the serial number of the first console you created the account with.” That would be my PS3 and I have it, however I feel like that is the point in every convo where they stop helping.

"X-Post from Playstation - Dualshock Not Charging/Connecting Hope this is the right place and someone can help me out! 

My Dualshock controller for PS4 stopped charging last week, I tried it on several cables to see if that was the issue but no dice. It’s super old so I figured I would get a new (preowned but “pristine) one and a new USB cable, just in case. Fast forward to today, cable + controller arrives, plug them in to the PS4, and the same issue - this time though because the new controller wasn’t connected, it wouldn’t connect through the USB cable. Neither controller will charge when I plug them into another USB socket either, and neither will charge/connect to the PS4. Because it’s the same issue with both controllers and one is brand new I’m hoping it’s user error, not a fault with my PS4. Has anyone had this problem before and knows how to resolve it?

Preferrably  just something turn based, bc my mom and stepdad still didn't fully  pick up on how the controller works even after those late night game  sessions. Just something a bit more slow so they don't stress about  making mistakes or ruining the game or get frustrated.

I  think it could also work with games like ""Keep talking and nobody  explodes"" in the ""only one player needs to use the actual controller but  everyone can play by making choices or discussing""- sense.I've  heard you can play hidden agenda like that but my sister is just really  squicked out by crime/thriller/horror stories. She can deal with more  detective like stories -some NCIS episodes, Lucifer, Monk, etc.- but  she's gone if we watch criminal minds or Law and order SVU.

I  know this is all pretty specifc and maybe something like that doesn't  exist, I already searched a bit on the internet without finding  anything, but if any of you have some ideas that would be great. Thank  You!! &lt;3",PS4,1

"Is it worth to buy a new TV for playing PS4 now? I'm thinking of buying a new TV for gaming, mostly because I want a better video quality and a bigger screen and because my current TV is starting to get old now (6-7 years, at least). However, in an year and half I'll probably be getting a PS5, so I was thinking that getting a new TV now could be a waste of money.

So, back to my question: is it worth it to get a TV for PS4 now?",PS4,1

So, my DS4 had been defective since the beginning, but it was a very small thing for almost a year and a half until it recently escalated.

Where I live, the DS4 price is ridiculous, and my only other options are Nacon Wired Compact Controller and Steelplay Metaltech Wired and Wireless.

"PS4 Pro - Will It Handle 16 Bit Audio on a Monitor w/ Speakers Plugged In as Audio Out? I had gotten a gaming display for my PC (Dell S2719DGF), and I was tempted to use it for my PS4 Pro.   


I have a regular 1080p TV that does 60hz, but I also have a display that does 1440p at 144hz. Sound-wise, the display has an audio out but it's 16 bit audio. Now my PC is running 16 bit audio and sounds great to me (no surround sound, just basic dual speakers).  


Now the theory I am working with is wanting to run my PS4 Pro via HDMI to this display, and then set the audio to output to my connected speakers with 16 bit audio output.

"Controller won't turn on after disassembly So yesterday i changed the rubber buttons for my ds4 (v1, so it's pretty old) and after getting everything back together almost correctly i noticed that the controller wouldn't work. I quickly reopened it and i noticed that the cable connecting the battery wasn't plugged all the way in: still, after fixing that minor issue, it wouldn't turn on. Generally when handling this kind of stuff i'm always as gentle as possible, but something must've gone bad this time.
For now i'm sure that the issue must be related at least with the 14 pin ribbon cable, being all bended from the previous owner: but even so, the controller would at least turn on, because the battery was at full charge before disassembly. So i even tried connecting it through bluetooth to my laptop (without the ribbon cable), but it wouldn't show up as a bt device. Any ideas on what could've gone wrong?

The Last of Us 2 is the only game that the 5.1 doesn’t work for me. Any ideas?

"spilled water on my PS4, am I fucked I was cleaning my desk and accidentally set of a chain reaction that caused a sup of water to fall on my PS4 Pro. I immediately unplugged everything from it and started wiping it off with a cloth I had on hand, dried the grooves and rear plugs, tipped it to make sure any loose water cam out and wiped that up. same thing with the two controllers that were hit.

I then quickly plugged it in to make sure it still turned on and it did, same with the controllers. I then unplugged it all and have put it out on the kitchen counter along with the controllers and associated cords. I'm not turning it on for the next couple days to get the moisture out. is there anything else I should/could do or is this all in vain",PS4,1

"Im having a problem I can’t find a single other reference to online or in discussions. Red dead redemption Ps4 Pro bundle console

About 2 months ago my PS4 bricked, went through safe mode and tried every option outside of initializing.

The problem is I can’t turn off my PS4 without it defaulting to the checking memory status 24% -27% then errors out to “cannot start PS4” 

I’ve gone through this now every time I turn the PS4 off as well as numerous other random errors. I’ve rebuilt the database, reinstalled 8.01 gotten everything back up and running like a default system... just to have it do it again the next time I turn off the console. So I’ve ran in safe mode for about the last week, accidents turned off off instead of rest tonight and it’s back to being a brick when I tried to turn it back on... it’s beyond frustrating having to redownload games but I can’t find a fix.

"Black Ops Cold War Review And Thoughts! &gt;! Cold War Review.......!&lt;

I have been playing cold war nonstop since release (as much as I can with work). I got myself to just about Prestige 2, keep in mind I am not the best player by any means.

There is a lot that I would like to talk about this game and get feedback about or possible game changes in a new update, maybe when season 1 comes to your screen.

\-First off the game is without a doubt very fun and I do enjoy it most of the time besides when I get pissy from campers of course :) I mostly snipe as I've always enjoyed it more than reggunning just because of the difficulty barrier in my personal opinion.

\-The snipers are trash most definitely every sniper would agree (compared to any COD made in the past) which is a big downfall for me. I did know this going into my preorder because I have a Ps4 and I played the Alpha before buying for the Beta and Launch, still it is sad and brutal for a hit to be this big to one of my favorite ways to play a Call Of Duty. Its not that you cant snipe and get nasty clips with the snipers but, it's not the same skill gap that we as snipers should have with the hard work put into learning to be good as a quick scoper.

\-**The Aim Assist is so insane,** being able to lock on to people across the map with just an ADS across the map is something that's never been a thing. It's like using a reggun with half wall hacks which consider the huge nerf to snipers is crazy to me. You would think at least the snipers would be on par with them but that's just not the case what so ever. Almost to the point where you don't want to snipe because your chances of losing are so high. As such the M16, Ak-47, MX4, Krig 6, QBZ-83, along with SMG's like the Milano 821, and the AK-74u that can outgun a Sniper at very long range kid of takes the fun out of sniping the nonexistent recoil is something out of this world as we know.

\-There is SOOOOO MANY times when you should most definitely kill people and the game just doesn't register your shot/kill. As well as kills that you shouldn't get and the game gives it to you, which can be very frustrating every time it happens to you. Especially when I'm Streaming or trying to hit clips for a Youtube video and kills that I should have got to finish a Feed, or almost getting one but ""*MISSING*"" that last shot that you needed to hit that 6 On Screen. Along with The Pellington 703 or the LW3 Tundra giving you a hitmaker on a deadset chest shot that should have killed the enemy player.

\-I don't know about you but a small/maybe big deal is the time it takes to level guns in this game is insane. I got 1200+ kills with my Pellington 703 and not only was it not Max Level yet but I wasn't even to level 50 with it, which means I'm not at the unlock at 53 on the gun to get the fastest ADS which is obviously needed in Cold War as a sniper. Without regguning sometimes I only average 20 kills a game with my snipers, so it takes forever to level up. Seeing a 40 kill sniper gameplay only get maybe a half level on the gun is insanity.

\-**LAST BUT NOT LEAST** I most definitely think when Warzone and Cold War link the guns will be OP and there is a reason behind it. Think about it if you have played the game you know the guns are so much stronger than the ones in Modern Warfare which are being used at the time. Every gun even copys from the past games are way stronger than they have ever been with a 150 HP multiplayer health. I mean look at the M16 it can kill you across map with a one body burst or even a few to the legs which is crazy. My personal belief behind this is that it's a Marketing Strategy to bring these OverPowered guns to Warzone and have all of the older guns be beat by the ones from Cold War. This will force people who enjoy winning, or Content Creators to have to go and buy the game to compete with what people are using and beating them with. Maybe I'm wrong and they will be balanced but as it stands now with the DPS thrown down that is what will happen with a straight class swap over.

So I do love the game but these are all issues and concerns I have with the game now, also with the future of this game and what Cold War converging with Warzone might look like if that is what happens get your $70 ready to buy and level guns up to win.

Please let me know what all you Beautiful people think about what I've commented on and your thoughts of the game so far and your experience playing. Have a great day and stay well, stay healthy, PEACE!!!

The seller seemed respectable and i trusted his assurance that it was working fine. (And I still do sort of trust the guy). 

But since I brought it home I haven’t been able to get Spider-Man to fully install. The install stops at 99% and tells me “an error has occurred.” 

Same with GTA 5, which was already loaded onto the console. It wants to update, gets to about 50%, and then quits. 

The console makes some funny noises, like the drive read stops and starts sometimes. Is that normal? 

Right now I’m doing a hard initialize and hoping that fixes something. But am I just totally fucked here? Are these common issues? Do I need to replace the hard drive — is that a common thing?

"Question about physical games + external HDD? Hi there? I have a question looking to the future of PS4 games.
I really prefered having physical games instead of digital ones. I love to collect and the disappearance of the digital games in the future.

My question is. Considering that a lot of physical games doesn't include the final files or patches so you need to download them from the store, it is possible to store this extra data into an external HDD like a backup and when you want to play or replay any physical game that you have it read that extra data from there?",PS4,1
"Is it a good idea to upgrade to the PS4 Pro before I get a PS5? So to give some context, I currently have a PS4 slim and this december will be its 4th birthday. It's been showing its age recently as it does feel laggy even in the system menu. Would it make sense for me to upgrade to a PS4 Pro before getting a PS5? Would I see a big jump in terms of performance and graphics? 

I would like to point out that my PS4 is my secondary gaming device, as I use my PC mostly, and I only play Sony and console exclusives on it.

Considering the shortages and scalpers of the PS5 and the lack of good first party games launched so far, I am going to be waiting a while before I get one. However I don't know for sure if I will wait a year or a few years right now.

"It looks like my PS4 is dying, and it appears to be the hard drive. If I buy a replacement internal hard drive, will that (likely) fix the problem? A couple of weeks ago I posted [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/jp5igj/video_a_couple_weeks_ago_i_downloaded_the_ufc_4/) about my PS4 struggling, and I did boot into safe mode to rebuild the databases, but no luck.  

I'm able to play games like Fall Guys and stuff like Netfilx works, but when I try playing NHL 21 I can't seem to connect to an online game (it worked twice, now it stops at 95% loading, pauses for a minute, then shows my opponent left) and playing offline is a buggy mess.  

My life has been a series of unfortunate events for the past 6-8 weeks so I am broke as hell, but my PS4 is basically my only leisure activity at this point so I'd like to save it if I can.  If I buy a replacement internal hard drive, is it plausible that will fix my problem?

"#ps4share videos gone from my facebook? Hey there,

Over the years I've shared a few funny clips that happened to me in overwatch onto my FB profile as videos. Obviously I did this when PS4 supported sharing directly to facebook. However, they now seem to have completely disappeared from my profile. I can't find them in my activity log when I used to be able to. I used to just search my log for #ps4share and there they'd be. I realise PS have discontinued FB support, but I feel like I've rewatched them since that happened. But no trace of them seems to exist now.   


Has this happened to anyone else? Is there are way to recover the videos. Not the end of the world if there's not, but I did enjoy some of those clips.

"PS4 HDD upgrade: use “Application Saved Data Management” or Restore to install game data? Sony’s directions for copying backup to new HDD say go to Settings&gt;Application Saved Data Management &gt; Saved Data on USB Storage Device &gt; Copy to System Storage.

When I tried this, I’m told no saved data found. 

When I go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Restore, it finds the data and begins the restoration process. 

Has anybody here encountered the same problem following Sony’s directions for HDD replacement?

I thought the problem might be that I formatted the backup drives inExFat instead of Fat32, so I transferred the PS4 &gt; EXPORT &gt; BACKUP&gt; folders to another device, reformatted as Fat32 and tried the Application Saved Data path again with no luck. 

Using one of the backup drives, the PS4 found the backup folders but said they’re was no saved data to copy. Using the other backup drive, PS4 didn’t even see the folders. 

This is my first time replacing a PS4 hard drive, so I’m not sure what to expect. The “Restore PS4” screen shows 30% completion with about 60 minutes left. 

If this doesn’t work, my next step barring a solution from the community, is to put the old HDD back in and hope the games and saves are still there. 

I read about making sure your logged into the same PSN account that was active when creating the backup. 99% sure I was, but if I have to start from scratch, that’s one thing I will check. 

I will also make sure I backup to a USB drive formatted Fat32 and no do any back and forth transferring and reformatting as described above.",PS4,1

"Games broken @ launch To the games publishers (I won't say devs because often they don't get a say) who release games that have a lot of serious bugs and it takes weeks to patch them out. 

All you're doing is eroding away your pre-order and day one purchasers, people won't pre-order your next game/s and they'll wait until after the release to purchase.
I appreciate once you've made a promise on a release date then in most cases that can't be changed but maybe you should do some risk analysis beforehand with the devs before you make a commitment to consumers on a release date. We can tolerate minor bugs and appreciate they can happen  but game breaking ones (corrupt saves etc.) are just not acceptable.

Game release success is often measured on the first weeks sales, we, the consumer won't purchase said game in week one, or two because we haven't our fingers burnt before.

My opinion of the entire Persona franchise hasn't changed a whole lot. I liked the jrpg aspects and felt that the dungeons gave a good enough challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole problem really stems down to the fact that from a narrative perspective the game isn't all that great. The first dungeon was really great all things considered, but there was just no forward momentum after that. Every dungeon and villain after that point got progressively worse and less developed in my opinion. 

I know this game and entire franchise really is made for people a little younger than me and I understand that. It is just not as good as I thought it would be given the hype",PS4,1

"GENESIS : the only top down view moba games on PS4 Hello everyone,

I hope that you are all fine.

Until last year, i was spending most of my free time playing league of legends, a moba games on pc, and was having fun doing so. Sadly, my pc end up dying and i was only able to watch streams on my phone.

Since my brother has a PS4, i start looking for a top down view moba that can be competitive enough to get me hooked. I found nothing... Until i heard of **GENESIS** (r/GENESIS\_moba\_PS4 ), a top down view free to play moba that was soon to be released on **PS4**.

I have start playing the game and it was and still is lot of fun. But even after existing for more than a year, the game don't have too many players.

That is probably thanks to their angry previous community manager that, after getting fired, post on the net that the game was going to close so people should stop supporting it.

That was back in January 2020. We are in November 2020 and the game still running up.

So if you like top down view moba games like **League of Legends** or **Dota 2**, i recommend you to try out **GENESIS**. 

It's free to play and available only on **PS4/PS5** at the moment. 

You can also join our newly made r/GENESIS_moba_PS4 for more informations. 

Thank you for reading my post 😊",PS4,1
"Need an advice regarding sudden problems on PS4: Am I going to have to send it back for repairs? Hi, my PS4 recently started acting up: suddenly slows down while on the menus and freezes for a short while when switching accounts (we have three accounts, I'll name each one as A, B, and C).

The problem probably started after I installed CODE VEIN where one out of three accounts (B) was having issues with the game (freezing, lagging) while the other two accounts have no issues at all. 

That is until today. After switching accounts from B to C, the PS4 started crashing. It force restarts and continues on a loop. We manually turned it off, waited for a good 5 to 10 minutes and booted  the PS4 again. It booted but we can't access account C anymore as it sends us back to that crashing loop. Using accounts A and B poses no issue at all, we were able to access notifications and settings but opening apps such as messages or profile also sends us back to that crashing loop. 

(Error code CE-36329-3 keeps popping up)

Upon researching, we tried to use the ""rebuilding database"" feature as I have read that it clears out bad sectors and lets the system perform better, and if not, atleast faster. And it may potentially repair corrupted databases. 

That didn't really worked so we resorted to initializing the ps4. After 2 to 3 hours it booted up again and displayed:

Database is Corrupted. PS4 will restart. (Error code CE-41813-7)

We tried Rebuilding the Database again but to no avail. And upon further reading, it suggested that we reinitialize PS4 (Reinstall System Software)

However, it doesn't read any of the flash drives we have here (tried 4 different ones, formatted them to the required type, downloaded the 1.1gb 8.01 file) and shows us SU-41333-4 error code.

What else should I do? Do I need to send it back to the Sony Retail Store to have it repaired?

Additional Notes: 

- I don't really know how to determine a broken HDD but as far as I've read, my PS4 doesn't really have any problem besides on what I stated above. Everything transpired today.

- PS4 is 11 months old from when I bought it.

- The only thing off about it is that it sounds like a jet engine sometimes.

"System Update   Hi r/ps4, hope you guys are doing good. I've been having problems with my PS4 Slim CUH-2511B (I have it memorized for some reason) Basically it asks to update the system using a USB drive. I'm able to then set it up and download one or two games but then the picture will freeze, the PlayStation will reset and then It'll bring me to the System Update Via USB. I've read that this problem can usually be traced back to the Hard Drive but I don't wanna jump to conclusions and get it replaces. If I could get some help that would be fantastic and if you need more details I'll give them to you in the comments. Thanks!",PS4,1

"Can I swap a hard drive from an old PS4 to a new one? Hey fellas,

Here's the situation:

A while back I had disassembled my old PS4 in an attempt to clean it, along the way I made an oopsie and it cannot be used without any soldering. 
I kept the hard drive just in case.

Today I got a bit lucky and we've scored a new black PS4 from my parents' friend who doesn't use it anymore.

My question is:

Can I place the Hard drive from my old PS4 into the new one without losing any save data and such?

Your help will be much appreciated.",PS4,1

Buddy's OG launch Ps4 Abruptly Stops Reading Disc's?

Seems like it's definitely something with the disc drive right? I just find it weird that it'll read the disc fine but only up to a point.

"PS4 save file lost then recovered after upgrading HD TL;DR if you need to use a previous HD to find a save file on PS4, boot into safe mode, pick update software via internet, and you should be able to find the file and back it up.

So this is a solution I dont know if anyone needs, but I just spent half the day trying to figure out. Basically, my external HD which contained all my games on PS4 crapped out and so I decided instead of getting a new external HD, I would just upgrade my PS4 hard drive from the 500gb stock HD to a 2tb SSD. Have PS plus, assumed my save files would be safe, mostly didn't care honestly, I'm more a PC gamer anyways. Walked in on my wife playing a Stardew, a game she invested hundreds of hours in, and was like, ""Why do you only have 500 bucks? Aren't you like a multi millionaire on here?"" She sadly told me she could find her save file and thus started the rest of my day. Looked online and found an old save file in the cloud, downloaded it, and nothing. I think what happened was when I redownloaded the game and she started a new game, it decided to overwrite her old save file in the cloud with the new empty file. She walked in on me in hour 4 of trying figure it out and tried to console me saying it was ok, it was just a game and that she didn't mind starting over. Unacceptable. As an avid gamer, I refused to accept this fate. Tried inserting the old HD and kept getting error messages, it didnt want to recognize the old HD after I installed the new one no matter what I did. Until a couple minutes ago I tried something that I didn't see posted anywhere. I remembered PS4 had a safe mode you can boot into and knowing that her save file HAD to be somewhere on the old HD, it was my last hope. Booted up in safe mode (hold down PS4 button when turning on and wait a couple seconds for the second beep) and on a whim picked update system software using internet. Downloaded the update and was able to find her save file (saved it to like 3 different places after this debacle) and am now waiting until morning to tell her. I've been walking around first pumping and whisper yelling, ""I'm the best! Call me Hackerman!"" for the last couple minutes.

A couple thoughts though - I'm not sure if this would have worked if a new version of the software wasn't available. Also, I'd be careful to not open the game before finding the old save file, backing it up on USB, and replacing the useless cloud save file.

Lesson learned: never depend on cloud storage. Especially on games you've invested more than a casual amount of hours into. Hope this helps anyone who has had this problem.",PS4,1

"Games crashing with CE-34878-0 error, almost all of them. Hi,
Have my PS4 since March. Last week I installed RDR 2, and at the same time system upgraded to 8.01. After playing for half an hour maybe, the game crashed with CE-34878-0 error. Then it started ti crash more and more often, and now it doesn't event go after cut scene of one of the missions. Tried to launch MK 11, it also crashes with same error even before it reaches start menu. Same woth God of War. Only game I was able to play is NFS.  One thing I noticed is that during NFS I cant hear fan at all, while for other games that are crashing, before blue screen appears the fan starts to spin up and then the games crash.
Re-initialization didn't help.
Has anyone had such problem since latest upgrade? Should I send it to PS support or should I try to open in and try to clean it first? I removed the top cover and checked the fan, but it's not that dirty, I know it does not mean that heatsink is clean so was thinking of opening and checking it property",PS4,1

"Sudden lag, need help troubleshooting For about a week now my PS4 has been unable to play online multiplayer games like Apex Legends or Overwatch due to huge lag spikes and sometimes getting kicked from servers entirely. I have very good internet, and no other devices are connected. I have noticed my latency, download and especially upload speed fluctuates rapidly constantly. For example, when doing connection tests, my upload speed would go from single digits to several hundred kbps just in the amount of time it took to run the test again. Here are things I have tried:

-Resetting the router
-Clearing out storage space
-Booting in safe mode and doing a database restore
-Using namebench to find better servers

"Videos acting up or not playing when in browser? I’ve got a PS4 Pro, bought it used and it has been fantastic for the most part. Has temporary freeze frame sometimes, not in game but in menu. For example if I decide to test internet connection it can get a little freezy when trying to get to settings.

It’s not unmanageable and honestly that doesn’t bother me at all, I’d just think that it would function more smoothly than a standard PS4. I’ve bought and sold 3 standard versions at different times for different reasons and in my experience my Pro doesn’t function more smoothly.

I’ve had problems with playing videos from browser with all my PS4. All of them played browser videos initially but for whatever reason stopped. I looked into it before back in the day trying to clear the cache I believe, I tried going into the settings with my Pro recently to see what I can do and I’m not 100% sure.

What the heck is it that eventually prevents the PS4 from playing browser videos??? Between FMovies not playing videos at all and Watchcartoononline where I’m lucky if the video starts, doesn’t freeze image(but continue sound) every 5 minutes, or randomly completely restarts the video.

"Game recommendations for dad and daughter to play together Looking for a new game to get into over the coming months.

Some games we've enjoyed together:

* Horizon
* GTAV (currently this is our go-to game -online)
* Unchartered
* Overcooked
* Horizon chase turbo

Ideally we'd prefer a game with co-op or local multi, but as you can see we get by with single player games by taking turns.

"Yo ñets talk about Bugsnax So the other day i decided to boot up the PS4 to give my PC a break from a week of non stop Yakuza:Like a Dragon. I was having a kind of bad morning , and around noon had decided to scrap the day as a loss and just play videogames.  I originally booted the system  planning on getting into Vallhalla, yet the events of the morning left my heart and my soul in a real dark place, so i decided to see what Bugsnax was all about. I figured i would knock out the story, delete it and hop into vallhalla. Pretty quickly though i was obsessed with catching every single googly eyed bugsnax and feeding them to my new friends. I had always wished thar Pokemon would eventually flesh out creature catching past the usual "" Slap thid electrocuted rat a couple times before shoving him into a ball"" routine that theyve been coasting with for awhile. Bugsnax however requires you to learn how each of the mouth watering creatures operate in order to catch them. Usually the way the loop goes is, youll do a little bit of Pokemon Snappin  by scanning each bugsnax with your camera,  which will give tou helpful hints on what might or might not work with each bugsnax. Then once your fairly certain that Strabby's can not resist Chocolate syrup, you can whip out your tools to get the job done. Some Bugsnax like the strabby are kinda adorably dumb and will walk right into your trap, while others like the pinkle have barriers you need to overcome, and some youll just plainly have to sneak up on. 

The fact that the gameplay is pretty fun, was ebough to make up for the gratingly repetitive mission structure,  as i think every misison in this game esdentislly reauires you to go out grab a bugsnax and feex it to one of the towns surprisingly well developed  characters.

You have come to snaktooth island in the hopes of your next big scoop, and what could be more trmpting to a budding journslist than an adventure on a mystefious island full of detectable wildlife. Only when you finnslly get there, shit has kind of gone off the rails and everyobe is kind of an asshole to eachother. The game balances some surprisingly heavy and buanced themes with its narrative. Every single one of the grumpuses is based around a very specific personality trait, which gives he cast an incredibly diverse feel.  but past the surface level stereotypes,  these grumpuses have really nuanced relationships with eachother that turn your this whimsical creature catching adventure into a deep complex narrative experience, atleast deeper thsn i ever expected from bugsnax. 

Bugsnax is a inherently chill game, throughout your entire stay on Snaktooth island you will be suffocated by a blanket of chill vibes and a ost that i could just listen to for hours on end. 
Though fair warning, if your planning on plstinuming this game on PS4... this game LOVES its loading screens. Thanks to the nature of the game, essentially being a walk here pick that up walk back sort of game, towards the latter half of my time with the game turned just a tad tedious.  These loadng screens can last upwards of a minute,  and it wsdnt uncommon to tun into one every 40 or so seconds 

This game is something special to me, and the time i spent platinuming this game within essentially a single sitting, will probably go down as one of the most chill and engaging gaming experiences ive ever had.

Nearly 6 years of saved games and data, probably 100s of hours of gameplay deleted to make my PS4 work again. Took a few minutes to recover what seems like all of them from the cloud. And here I was uninterested in this feature before.

Thank you.",PS4,1

"Just got a ps4 pro for a good price. Any recommendations on games? I was a sony fanboy for the longest time until the end of the ps3 era.  A bad experience with the most fucking retarded sony customer service rep I've ever dealt with soured me on sony.  I sold everything ps3 related and bought an Xbox one the next day.

I have no regrets in my actions as the xbox one was a great console and offered me features and games sony couldn't.  But there no doubt I missed out on a lot.

I bought the pro used cause that sour taste is still there, even if its just a little bit.  I didn't want to give sony any money just yet.

I picked up GoW, MLB 20, uncharted, and attack on titan (not exclusive i know, but it was cheap for a used copy) What other exclusives should I pick up?

"Recommendations For ** 8TB ** External Drive for PS4 Pro I'm looking to buy an \*\* 8TB \*\* (nothing smaller) external drive for a PS4 Pro and looking for recommendations from those who have come before me in this area.

Would I be correct in assuming 8TB SSD's are out of the question, mainly because I don't think they even have 8TB SSD's.  So if so an 8TB option MUST be a spinner right??

I also understand that Seagate has partnered with Sony for their line of external drives but I understand most of it is probably just marketing with the PS logo on the drive housing and the guts of the drive are no different from any other drive, and I also think these max out at 4TB, right?

So if my understanding is correct, for the  8TB option I'd be looking at a mechanical hard-drive, probably in the 3.5"" variety (as again, I don't think 8TB comes in a 2.5"" drive, right?), and I'm thinking for speed the 7200 RPM is a must, vs a 5400 RMP?

So clarification of the above assumptions would be appreciated and then what has worked for YOU and what you'd do again if you had to do it over.

Recently, I purchased the base Fallout 4 game from the PlayStation Store (rookie mistake, I didn’t buy the GOTY edition). If I buy the GOTY edition now, will it transfer my save file? Alternatively, is there some other way I can have access to the DLC’s without paying $50 for the season pass?

I realize this is my mistake, and I should have had the forethought to just buy the GOTY edition. However, it would be neat to see if PlayStation had some system in place that kept me from paying four times the money just because I didn’t get the GOTY edition. 

If I can transfer saves and just pay the $20 for the GOTY edition, I’d be just as happy.",PS4,1

"AC Origins is an amazing game I've been a fan of the Assassin's Creed games ever since Ezio. But for various reasons I didn't enjoy some of those following (Black Flag, Syndicate) as much, and was beginning to cool on it all.

Then I played Origins. This game is just breathtaking: an incredibly beautiful and detailed world, so much to do, and each region unlike any other. I could watch the day-to-day interactions of the citizens for hours. I love sending Senu (my eagle) up to scout out an area I'm about to infiltrate, to find the best way to attack, or just coast on a breeze and admire the view. I've pretty much maxed out my character (Bayek), but there are still people and situations that make me think twice and go carefully before plunging in.

I'm getting near the end (at least, I think I am) and at no point has it felt like a grind. And even now I'm finding new and unexpected attention to detail, one of which I loved so much it inspired me to write this whole post. Bayek was in a small village, on the way to the blacksmiths to sell some gear, and one of the local cats came up to him to check him out. On a whim I had him crouch down next to it. And after a moment, Bayek reached out and stroked the cat's head.

"PS4 Pro no longer pulling in disc out of the blue My PS4 Pro suddenly stopped pulling in discs. It seems the blocking mechanism that would prevent from inserting another disc is always active. That mechanism is not active right after I started booting the PS4 Pro, it would pull a disc in just perfectly the first one or two seconds after I started the PS4 Pro. But once the PS4 Pro has fully booted, it will not longer pull a disc in.

Besides mentioned workaround the only thing that sometimes works is holding the Eject Button for 5 seconds or so. The PS4 Pro would then make funny noises like it is trying to initiate a disc. But since no disc is in the PS4 Pro it just makes weird loud noises. It does this 4-6x times and after those 10-15 it would sometimes pull a disc if I forcefully insert it 70% the way in. Oh and it will also make those noises if I start the PS4 Pro without a disc in or without me inserting a disc right after start. So now I really have to have a disc in the PS4 Pro on start or otherwise it would greet me with mentioned noises for 10 seconds.

So long story short, my PS4 Pro kind if actively blocks me from inserting a disc when fully booted but two workarounds kind of help.

The fishy thing is that this happened a day after I installed Firmware 8.01. Could be just a coincidence but wanted to mention. The fact that the pull and auto detection of trying to insert a disc works for a brief moment after I started the PS4 is kind of strange as it would mean there is no hardware defect but the then fully loaded OS blocking the disc drive from working properly.",PS4,1

"PS4 Slim cannot associate controllers + System Software problem I know it's long but I hope someone will read it

I have a PlayStation 4 Slim that suddenly couldn't use controllers: they are not recognized even with USB cable and I can't enter in the PS4 home menu, but they work in the Safe Mode menu (so I exclude USB problems).

Also, I couldn't reach Safe Mode in the standard way (by pressing power button for 7s when PS4 is turned off) but only by pressing power button for 7 seconds, release for 1s, and keep the button pressed again until the second ""beep"": when I tried the standard way, the 2nd ""beep"" don't occur after 7s but it takes longer, and after that PS4 just turn off again (without showing anything on screen, it just turn on and off immediately I think).

In the Safe mode I tried ALL OPTIONS and NONE of them worked. Neither Internet or USB update or USB System Software Reinstall, they start but give an error when arrive to 100%.

I used another working PS4 to put the previous one's HDD and I was able to Reinstall System Software via USB, and then to enter in the PS4 home menu (so HDD works properly). Then I put this HDD in the faulty PS4 and I got more problems: ""Impossible to startup PS4"". It asked me to connect a USB with updatet System Software and when I do it just give me an error. Again, nothing in the Safe Mode works, so now I have 2 problems...

After being frustrated with not being able to share and collaborate on links with fellow gamers, I created [SeeLink](https://seelink.app/), a platform to simplify sharing and collaborating on links with fellow gamers. 

Conventionally, sharing links with people was done through messaging apps, where they would get lost in the sea of messages. [SeeLink](https://seelink.app/) allows its users to create boards to share links with individuals / groups of people, allowing them to save and share human-readable links at the click of a button. 

After 3 months of work, I have created a complete platform that simplifies link sharing and collaboration, allowing you to seamlessly share, save, and collaborate on links with thousands of people. For example, you could share links to up and coming RPGs or games with fellow gamers.

"PS4 Problems So my PS4 has been acting strange as of late. First started when my son was playing Fortnite and the game randomly shut off and sent him back to the PS4 Home Screen (this is reoccurring btw).

Now when I power it down and power it back on after while, it updates itself and will either go to the main screen or shut off by itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Having a PS4 for a long time now, I didn't have any problem with it and always been happy to have it. One problem is related to the console is the game and the connection that are not handling well, let me explain.

&amp;#x200B;

I like playing Pro Evo Soccer, and there always been a thing where servers don't like when you are using wi-fi, and they tell you about it too. So even if you have a super high quality wi-fi, you will probably find yourself having some issues, and you might understand that it can be a problem.

I do have a wired connection though, but my problem is the connection. Unstable, can't do two things, any videos on whatever platform is destroying my latency, easily can get from 75 to 900 just by browsing the web.

&amp;#x200B;

So I would like to use my 4G, which I use on a daily basis for gaming on PC, without having any issues, but because I need that ""wired"" connection, I usely use USB Tethering but can't find a way to do it on the PS4.

"Spider-Man: Miles Morales PS4 - mixed emotions after completing the story I thoroughly enjoyed the Spider-Man game when it came out in 2018 &amp; for Miles Morales the week it came out. Context: I only just finished TLOU 2 &amp; had a mentally exhausting experience playing that game, so was looking for something fun to play.

I beat the story in the first 3-4 days! That's it. There are several side missions to complete but the emotional core of it is all done. The gameplay though instantly recognisable was super great &amp; the story was fine. But, I feel that it's too short a game to pay full price for.

I'm from India. A game like TLOU2 or Cybepunk 2077 is priced at INR 4,000/- (~$54). And those are huge huge huge games. And then SM:MM is priced the same! I just feel that this game could have been a DLC or maybe as a small follow-up. It's the same debate of FIFA 21 being priced at INR 4,000/- whereas PES 2021 saying that it's just an update. So, you can buy my game for INR 2,500/-.

"Doom (2016) overheats PS4 like nothing else I downloaded Doom (2016) and when playing the first 5 minutes or so, the console made a noise like I never heard before. As I knew it was the fan, I touched the console, and that thing was about to melt the outer crust of the planet. Anybody knows why? FYI I air-dusted the console not too long ago, and I also play other graphically demanding games (GTA V [digital], Battlefield 1 [physical], and RDR2 [physical] for example), and never had this issue. It does get hot, but this time was something else. Only Doom (2016) makes my PS4 overheats. Is it a very demanding game? Or is there another explanation to this?",PS4,1

* Basically if you press the power button, the PS4 will turn off after about 10-15 seconds; it does this every single time.
* The power cable doesn't need to be removed to keep trying this process; it just doesn't complete the boot.
* No blue light of death and have tried some of the various fixes out there (unplugging overnight, holding power button, etc.).
* Can turn it on using my paired PS4 controller but again it turns off after 10-15 seconds

My brother has his own PSN account. 

I have my own PSN account. 

Combined, we currently have three PS4s and one PS5. We’ve been sharing games on each other’s PS4s. The “activated” PS system is currently the one I mainly use. 

My brother is currently dying of cancer. He has weeks left. He wants to give one of the PS4 to a friend and to add him to the network. Friend has their own PSN account as well (but no games on it).  Friend can download game and play them through my brother’s account, but cannot play them on his own account. I, however, have not had any issues playing any games (whether purchased under his account or mine) on my account. 

Any idea of what I need to do to help my brother’s friend get set up so that he can play all games as well?  If he sets his PS4 up as the primary one, does that mean I lose access to the games my brother purchased on my PSN account?

Is it even possible for me to merge my account with my brother’s account after he dies?  Will Sony allow this to happen?

"10 More Overlooked Single Player Indie Games [Here’s a link to the first post with 10 other overlooked indie games.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/j6xnhe/10_overlooked_single_player_indie_games/) 


**Introduction**

We're all familiar with the Hotline Miami's, Hollow Knight's, and Celeste's of the world. These are some of the indie games that hit the big time. Of course, for every one of these games, there's 100 other indie games that have been glossed over, relegated to a spot in a digital store few people will ever find themselves in. I wanted to bring attention to some of these lesser known indie games again.

I'm going to order them according to Metacritic Critic Ratings. For the three at the bottom that don't have any Critic Ratings, I will instead order them by User Ratings. Some of the user ratings are low for certain games that I personally disagree with, but it's only fair that you hear from more than just me. I do want to say though that a number of the low scores are complaints related to difficulty, which is usually a preference. #1 on the list, for example, is nowhere near NES hard and has very frequent checkpoints and no lives system. Just an FYI for those who might be turned off by some of the low user scores.

**Price** will include a link to the U.S. store page of the game. **Price** is in U.S. dollars.

**1. Valfaris**

* *Price:* [$24.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5834-CUSA17672_00-VALGPS4DIRESIEA0) - Currently on sale for $11.24

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/DC276pF)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=758YGA4Rp3Y)

* *Genre:* Run &amp; Gun

* *Metacritic:* [80% from 9 Critic Reviews, 63% from 25 User Ratings]( https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/valfaris)

* *Description:* Valfaris is one of the best run &amp; gun games I've ever played. It's themed around a fictional planet and has a gross alien vibe coupled with heavy metal music. The music doesn't override the other audio in the game, and it does a nice job of upping the ante when you're fighting a boss - of which there are many. You're equipped with a primary gun, a more powerful mana-based gun, a sword, and a shield that can block with mana or parry. There are a number of weapons to acquire throughout the game, and the guns in particular do a great job of feeling different. There are checkpoints every two minutes or so, and most bosses will have a checkpoint just before them (only the weaker bosses come after a gauntlet of enemies). The game is a little hard at points, but overall it strikes a nice balance of feeling accomplished for overcoming the challenges without getting overly frustrating.

* *Completion Time:* ~8 Hours

* *Extra Content:* There are a few secrets to find throughout the game that are off the beaten path, though I was able to find 2/3 of them on my first playthrough. I found all but one weapon as well. The replayability comes from New Game+, which allows you to take all your upgraded weapons into a harder version of the game. Since the weapons all function a bit differently, this can be lots of fun.

**2. Reverie**

* *Price:* [$12.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0812-CUSA11709_00-RAINBITESREVERIE)

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/IRkaAXK)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LhU6_-c9DE)

* *Genre:* Zelda-like Top Down Action Adventure

* *Metacritic:* [75% from 1 Critic Review, 55% from 11 User Ratings]( https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/reverie)

* *Description:* Reverie is a mix between Zelda’s gameplay, Earthbound’s aesthetic and humor, and a New Zealand folktale – the legend of Maui and the Giant Fish. Instead of the more traditional sword and shield style fantasy, Reverie instead opts for items and tools a modern boy is more likely to find in his possession, like a cricket bat, a yoyo, and a nerf gun. Similarly, the first dungeon is grandpa’s basement, where you’ll square off against a giant hedgehog and a tumble dryer. That said, the game does get more fantastical with the last two locations, particularly the last one. It’s a relatively easy game overall, though the fourth and especially fifth dungeon offer up a moderate challenge. The indie scene has produced a lot of Zelda-like games in recent years, but this is the only one I know of that isn’t your standard medieval fantasy.

* *Completion Time:* ~5 Hours

* *Extra Content:* There are feathers to collect, mini games to play, and a combat focused bonus dungeon to beat. That said, a lot of this stuff is easy to stumble upon in the main quest, so you’re probably looking at about two or three hours’ worth of content after beating the game to complete everything and get the platinum trophy.

**3. Inertial Drift**

* *Price:* [$19.99 – Currently on sale for $15.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4293-CUSA17431_00-000INERTIALDRIFT)

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/E0VPS0v)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMUZ9wHtuOY&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation)

* *Genre:* Racing

* *Metacritic:* [74% from 6 Critic Reviews, 50% from 1 User Ratings]( https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/inertial-drift)

* *Description:* Inertial Drift's distinguishing characteristic is its employment of the right analog stick for drifting. This takes a little getting used to, but it feels great once you get the hang of it, creating some exhilarating moments when perfecting corner turns. The game has 10 unique tracks + 10 reversed tracks, 16 vehicles, and four separate story arcs. Each story arc is only a couple of hours long and features a different protagonist with a different vehicle. There's quite a bit of dialogue between races, and in the races themselves characters will frequently dish out positive commentary on your performance in the form of text in the top left hand corner of the screen. The game's aesthetics are a fusion of anime and synthwave. I've heard many fans liken the game to the manga Initial D, though I'm unfamiliar with that series myself.

* *Completion Time:* ~3 Hours (for 1/4 Story Arcs)

* *Extra Content:* There are a number of different modes including a Story Mode, Challenge Mode, Grand Prix Mode, Arcade Mode, two player Split-Screen, and Online, as well as a Tutorial. Completion of challenges in Challenge Mode allows you to unlock new vehicles for the other non-Story Modes. Grand Prix Mode allows you to race using different characters/vehicles through a connected set of challenges, while Arcade Mode is for one-off races. I wouldn't recommend this game for online play as the user-base is pretty small (hence it being overlooked) and you're unlikely to find a match.

**4. Warlock’s Tower**

* *Price:* [$4.99 – Currently on sale for $1.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0891-CUSA10782_00-RATAGWARLOCKSTOW/)

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/g6rFWUE)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj_pQvwD8FM)

* *Genre:* 2D Level-based Puzzle Game

* *Metacritic:* [73% from 3 Critic Reviews, N/A from 0 User Ratings](https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/warlocks-tower)

* *Description:* Warlock’s Tower’s puzzles are built around the movement of the player. There are numbers on the ground for the player to pick up – either 3 or 5 – and this gives the player a set number of steps before they die. Your goal in every level is to make it to an exit, and you’ll have to acquire the numbers in an order that gets you there. It is a bit easy in the beginning but eventually works up to be a challenge in the later levels as more elements are introduced: enemies, teleporters, conveyors, and even controlling two characters at once that share movement usage. The game has a very believable GameBoy aesthetic and sound effects to accompany it, and it works for this slower paced tile-based game.

* *Completion Time:* ~6 Hours

* *Extra Content:* This is published by Ratalaika Games, but surprisingly enough, you actually have to beat the game and find a few NPCs hidden in certain levels to get the platinum trophy. There are optional levels in each world that don’t have any trophies attached to them, and this should add a few hours to the game.

**5. The Count Lucanor**

* *Price:* [$14.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1260-CUSA07937_00-THECOUNTLUCANORM)

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/iyd1QmN)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhXJ4QG94qM)

* *Genre:* Top Down Adventure/Horror

* *Metacritic:* [70% from 2 Critic Reviews, 66% from 10 User Ratings]( https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-count-lucanor)

* *Description:* The Count Lucanor’s story is very fairy tale-esque – more like a classic fairy tale as it can be pretty dark and grotesque at times. On his 10th birthday, Hans chooses to leave his mother in a quest for wealth. After some walking and conversation with NPCs you find along the way, you stumble upon a large mansion and find that the count of this mansion is looking to pass his wealth onto an heir who can prove himself worthy – “worthy” in this case being the one who can figure out the count’s name. From here, you are tasked with adventuring through the mansion and solving environmental puzzles in a nonlinear way to acquire the letters that spell the count’s name. There is a survival horror element to the game, as you are unable to attack the enemies in the mansion and instead must crawl under tables and find other ways around them. You can place candles around the mansion to light it up to help you better evade enemies, but your usage is limited (though you can find more).

* *Completion Time:* ~4 Hours

* *Extra Content:* There are five different endings and some puzzles/rooms you don’t even have to do. This could double your playtime – maybe even more if you don’t use a guide. The platinum trophy requires every ending and a few other things but is pretty easy to get if you use a guide.

**6. The Bunker**

* *Price:* [$19.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4459-CUSA06057_00-THEBUNKERGAMEPS4)

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/vKvMqpO)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rShTPLd_7c)

* *Genre:* FMV Point &amp; Click Adventure/Horror

* *Metacritic:* [69% from 14 Critic Reviews, 59% from 39 User Ratings](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-bunker)

* *Description:*  The Bunker is an FMV point &amp; click adventure, meaning it features real actors and environments just like a live action movie. Many of the actors involved have been in high profile movies/TV shows as well, including The Hobbit, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, and Penny Dreadful. The game takes place in a fallout shelter and follows the last survivor as he tries to find a way outside following the death of his mother, after living 30+ years in the bunker. The gameplay has you solving puzzles and finding ways to proceed to the next area. The story is the focal point of the game though, and it frequently switches between the past and the present to tell its story. There’s a good juxtaposition between the lively past and the lonely present that makes you question how the protagonist ended up as the last survivor. There’s only one narrative choice to make in the game, and it comes at the very end. The game also works in handheld mode with touchscreen functionality if you'd prefer to play it that way.

* *Completion Time:* ~2. Hour Completion Time* 

* *Extra Content:* You can replay the game and try to find all the collectibles. Most of them give more background on the story. You can trigger the ending you did not choose the first time around by simply reloading the last checkpoint, so there is no need to play through the whole game again to unlock it.

**7. SINNER: Sacrifice for Redemption**

* *Price:* [$18.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4338-CUSA11129_00-SINNERSACRIFICEF)

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/Rzf9a8s)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkeg6nBr8ug)

* *Genre:* Soulslike Action Adventure

* *Metacritic:* [57% from 8 Critic reviews, 38% from 15 User Ratings](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption)

* *Description:* SINNER: Sacrifice for Redemption is a Soulslike boss rush. There are eight bosses, the first seven allowing you to fight in any order, each representing the seven deadly sins. You are equipped with everything the game has to offer from the beginning (except for the New Game+ weapon they give you), and instead of becoming more powerful, you gradually lose things with each boss you defeat, hence the “sacrifice” in the title. It’s like a reverse RPG. Each boss has a different sacrifice associated to it – one may deplete your throwing items’ usage, while another will deplete your health and stamina. Picking the best order to fight them in adds a little strategic thinking to the game, as you may be more dependent on your large health and stamina bar more than your throwing items’ usage, for example. The game is fairly difficult, so your victories over each boss feel very gratifying when they do come.

* *Completion Time:* ~5 Hours

* *Extra Content:* There is New Game+ that offers you an additional weapon.

**8. Verlet Swing**

* *Price:* [$14.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2187-CUSA15193_00-VSPS4SIEADIGI001)
* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/Q5XNLyE)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcrc5DQLPFY)

* *Genre:* 3D Platformer

* *Metacritic:* [N/A from 0 Critic Review, 80% from 2 User Rating]( https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/verlet-swing)

* *Description:* Verlet Swing’s aesthetic is as intriguing as its gameplay: you are tasked with grappling and swinging yourself across these vaporwave styled levels without hitting anything. The levels are all very short, but you’re likely to play many levels dozens of times before even finishing it… just to get a 1/4 rank. The ranking system is actually very cool, in that it encourages you to find alternative paths or sometimes just building up more momentum to get to the end faster. Most levels do seem to have a set path, but at the same time, with the proper grappling of the mechanics, you can forge your own, which is a game in itself. 

* *Completion Time:* ~7 Hours

* *Extra Content:* There’s an in game challenge menu that mostly recycles a lot of the base game content – though there’s a particularly funny one that switches the perspective to third person to play as a knockoff Spiderman. You can also go back and try to get the best possible time for each level. Getting the platinum trophy is extremely hard and I believe is at 0.1% completion.

**10. Neon Drive**

* *Price:* [$9.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1918-CUSA08151_00-0004334033028820

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/0sctlU6)

* *Trailer:* [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrqES7nGUwA&amp;ab_channel=GamingSoon)

* *Genre:* Rhythm

* *Metacritic:* [N/A from 0 Critic Reviews, 70% from 7 User Ratings](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/neon-drive)

* *Description:* Neon Drive is a challenging rhythm game with a synthwave aesthetic and appropriately matching music. The objective of the game is to evade the obstacles coming at you by transitioning between four lanes at the right moment using either two of the face buttons, D-Pad, or shoulder buttons. Personally I found the shoulder buttons worked best. The game will occasionally transform you into other vehicles that mix the gameplay up a bit - one notable example is when you turn into a plane and transition between eight lanes in a 360 degree orientation. There are only eight levels that are all about three minutes in length if you were to beat them with no deaths, with two checkpoints and two health points that regenerate between checkpoints. While this all sounds very generous, most of these levels will still take you dozens of tries, though the life reset is almost immediate so you can get back into the action right away.

* *Completion Time:* ~3 Hours

* *Extra Content:* There are two harder difficulties, an endurance mode that sees how long you can go without dying, a free run mode that allows you to play through the game without reset (only unlocked after beating each level), and online leaderboards. The trophies are very hard to get, and there is no platinum trophy.

** 8. Tamashii**

* *Price:* [$11.99 – Currently on sale for $5.99](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2187-CUSA16338_00-TMSPS4SIEADIGI00)

* *Picture:* [Link](https://imgur.com/a/bZax3Y8)

* *Trailer:* [Slightly Graphic (Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJqBk32CENM)

* *Genre:* Puzzle Platformer

* *Metacritic:* [N/A from 0 Critic reviews, N/A from 0 User Ratings](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/tamashii)

* *Description:* Reportedly inspired by obscure Japanese games from the late 1980s and 1990s, Tamashii blends puzzle platforming together with an oppressive atmosphere. The introduction starts with the character being willed into existence by a godlike character that tasks him with destroying the macabre forces that have taken control of his chambers. Your character is able to spawn three inanimate clones of himself which is the primary source for most of the platforming and some of the boss fights – you’ll use them to trigger switches and open up new paths. There’s about an even mix of puzzle solving and platforming, and there’s a whole eight bosses in this short adventure (though one is a secret) that are probably the most visually interesting moments in the game. The difficulty is about average – maybe slightly easier than most indie puzzle platformers.

* *Completion Time:* ~2.5 Hours

* *Extra Content:* There are a few obscure secrets to discover. You can also play through the chambers again with a score meter, and there are certain trophies associated with getting a good score. The platinum trophy isn’t too hard to get, but you’ll probably need a guide for some of the secrets.

Special shoutout to **Valfaris** which is my favorite game on the list and, again, one my favorite 2D run &amp; guns ever.

"The Witcher 3 save game transfer regular version to GOTY? Hello dear witcher!

I bought The Witcher 3 some time ago and just last week started to play it, Wonderful game by the way!

I thogúght to myself that I want to play the DLCs as well, ocne I finished the base game and so I have to buy the expansion pass, which costs 25$. Now iwth the black friday sales, the GOTY version is on sale for 15$, the expansion pass not, still being at 25$.

I already googled and, for what reason ever, it is actually not possible to take over the save and carry on with GOTY?  


I have to say I really hate this. This is actually nonsense.  
I would buy the GOTY, if I did not already pump close to 30 hrs into the game... I don't want to do it all over again, and now I have to pay 10$ more, just because I have the base game only?  


Will the expansion pass ever go on sale? It would make sense to discount the GOTY and the expansion pass as well.  


Well, let me stop the rant, but my question is:  


Is there any unofficial like program or hack, which would make it possible to hack the save so it actually can be transferred to the GOTY version?

After downloading and then updating, the system restarted and on restart I just have a blank screen.  It just stays blank.  Holding the power button does nothing, nor does holding the power button on the controller.  After so long I pulled the power cable, and then restarted the system.

At first it will say checking storage device, then it will restart and I'll see the Playstation symbol, then the screen just goes blank again, same problem.

"New to PlayStation: Is an SSD upgrade on a PS4 worth it? Not the PS4 Pro. Hi Everyone, 

One of my friends is offering to sell me his old PS4, which isn’t the PS4 Pro, but rather the one before that. I’ll probably get it for a decent deal, maybe 100-150 AUD. 

Just a side note, I’m really just interested playing a few titles such as Fallout 4, Mafia DE and maybe play through GTA V again. Just really basic games - maybe even watchdogs or even other games people might suggest in this thread. 

I can’t really justify a PS5 right now, as I’m usually too busy to seriously game anyway - not to mention It’s sold out everywhere. I also feel like buying a brand new PS4 Pro is sort of a waste of money; when I can spend a few hundred more and get the new PS5. 

So my original question, is spending an extra hundred or so on an SSD upgrade, on top of buying my friends PS4 (not pro) worth the performance increase? 

Thank you everyone in advance for the answers.",PS4,1

If you activate account B as primary (without manually deactivating A before) will the console also move in 'Device Management' to account B on Sony's website ?,PS4,1

"HELP! PS4 Pro... Life support My PS4 pro is basically a paper weight right now and playstation customer service is MIA. Hoping the community can help.

Installed Destiny 2 Beyond Light. Played for about 5 days and got an error saying the game was corrupted.

Reinstalled D2 fresh.

PS4 was starting to lag on every game (loading screens especially).

Rebuilt the database a couple times. Didn't seem to do anything.

Deleted messages and notifications and did another rebuild of the database... Now I can't get it to start outside of safe mode. When I turn it on the PS4 logo comes up and then won't initialize. Just the blinking blue light mocking me...

Reinstalled software (8.0).

Initialized.

Initialized with software.

Replaced HDMI cable.

Checked all ports.

Reseated the SSDD.

Not convinced it's BLOD since I can still start in safe mode.

About the only thing I can think of is to replace the SSDD. But I would hate to throw $50-$100 at this problem and it not work.

PS4 is out of warranty.

"What should I do before taking my PS4 in for repairs? *Sorry if my flair is wrong, not sure if question or tech support fit my problem.*  


**Quick overview:** I need to have my console deep cleaned and replace the disc drive. Once I get it back, I also plan on swapping out the hard drive for a better one. *What I have on the console are:* my general PSN account - my games (no save data), my trophies I guess, movies I bought, etc.

**Details:** I read that backing everything up is a given when trying to fix / take apart your console. However I don't have another 1 TB device or PS +, so how would I get past this point? On the same note, I wanted to take it in like it is with all my stuff so that the guy can see if his repairs hold. Don't wanna spend 3 hours factory resetting it, get it back in 2 weeks, and spend another couple of hours trying to set it back up to check myself.

I was thinking about ""clean"" reset or whatever it is called, so there is absolutely nothing on the Playstation, but then again - is it possible and safe to download any games from digital library (so as to have better offer to sell) so the buyer can have them downloaded on HDD, but can install it with his own/other account ? For example, he/she would like to have ""Fall Guys"" which I have from my PS+ in the games library. Or should I just remove everything completely just to be safe ?

"PS4 controllers (including wired) not connecting to the PS4 itself despite resetting values, buying new controller etc, does anybody have a solution to this sort of problem/has anyone experienced this situation before? To put it in a more detailed point the PS4 I have is the PS4 that originally came out back in 2014, a family friend gave it to me a little while ago when they upgraded to the PS4 Pro. For a while I was able to play and enjoy being on the PS4 but for some reason the controller stopped working both wirelessly and wired via USB cable/charging cable. There was no problem with the controller charging, only connecting; so I bought another controller thinking it was a controller problem, low and behold it was working albeit only for three days before going back to the state where the PS4 wouldn’t detect the controller, wired or wireless.

But the weird part is this:
The controllers can’t connect no matter what and yet whenever I connect to Safe Mode the controller works PERFECTLY, which lead me to see if resetting some settings would make it work which did once before going back to the original problem. The controllers both old and the new one not connecting to the PS4 wired via a cable.

Short question is, did anybody have this experience and how did you fix it? Is there a home remedy that would work that doesn’t involve tampering with the hardware or do I have to take it to a repair shop?

"Corrupt Database; deleting system software Hello! The database is corrupt on this PS4, I've researched online and will be getting a big enough USB stick to hold the update in a week.

However I'm trying all the other methods I've been looking at first. I can luckily access the home screen &amp; settings with major 15 minute lag spikes, and have backed up the save data to the cloud.

Onto the main topic; if I delete the system software by going to notifications (Recommended by PlayStation support) will this delete users too, as in we would have to login again with emails &amp; passwords?

I'm not certain everybody recalls their information so I can do it now if it won't touch that portion, or wait until I can get confirmation from everybody that they do in fact remember their log-in shenanigans.",PS4,1

"Controller connection help Basically, My ps4 pro has been factory reset and the controller I have isn't syncing to the console. When I press the PS button it flashes orange once and then goes dead. I've tried everything like hard reset, reset the controllers with the small hole, used safe mode, used 4 different USB cables, holding the PS button and the share button. I even bought a brand new controller but the same thing happened. The controllers also flash white but I think that means they are on and both controllers can connect to my mac book air via Bluetooth.

"PS4 Slim clicking noise then game freezes What happens is I hear a series of 3 clicking noises coming from my ps4 that repeats over and over for about 1-2 minutes until the game freezes and I have to hold down the power button for 30+ seconds to get it to turn off. It starts back up and checks the storage status and then starts up normally, telling me the ps4 was not turned off properly. I have looked online alot about this issue (as I have had this issue for 1.5-2 years now) but cannot find anything related to my specific problem with the 3 clicks. I have seen a video of someone experiencing the clicking hard drive failure and the clicks are much different. I will try to get a video or sound clip next time it happens. Does anyone know what the problem might be? Is it possible to rule out hard drive failure as this problem has been happening for somewhere close to 2 years? Could this be an overheating issue? (The ps4 is quite hot when this happens). Any help or advice would be appreciated, I seriously do not know my stuff when it comes to ps4 internals.",PS4,1

"Any way to change email on file, if password forgotten on main email and backup email? Hey all.  I asked this in the Playstation sub but didn't get any hits, so trying here. 

This may have been asked before, however not much luck after scrolling past the MANY new ps5 posts.  So here's the thing. I've had my email since the start. Its a really old one. Well, the issue is, I've long forgotten the password. But for a password reset or request, it goes to ANOTHER email that I no longer use (and don't know the password for). And THAT email sends a password reset to the one that I have for Playstation. So you can see my dilemma. Both of these emails were set up long before using a cell phone as a backup.  Am I just S.O.L? I've got 2FA for the Playstation, but still. Recently I've been thinking about how I don't use the email nor have access and wanted to update things.

"Devil May Cry 5 has the best combat mechanics and system for an action game. Prove me wrong. It has absolutely everything in one package with a character like Nero where he is ideal for newcomers with only one weapon with a high skill ceiling if played properly along with the combination of a myriad of devil breakers that will never tire the combat. Dante is literally the greatest action character created with how complex and deep you can go with his moveset and just having so many options at your disposal.

"First time installing a new HDD into my PS4 Pro, can anyone answer some questions for me? Did some googling and couldn't find an appropriate response. So a few months back my PS4 Pro bricked (irrefutable and absolute HDD corruption down to the core) and once it became evident that I won't be getting my hands on a PS5 anytime soon, I finally broke down and bought a new 1TB hard drive earlier today. My question is concerning the firmware. I know you're supposed to download it directly from Sony onto a USB and download it onto the console from there, but I don't have a spare USB floating around and if I can avoid spending even more money I would like to. If my console is hardwired to the internet, can I download the firmware directly to the drive from safe mode? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I just genuinely don't know.

Bit of a coincidence this is happening just as the Ps5 is being released?

"PS4 has no signs of life. (HELP) My PS4 recently stopped giving a signal to the TV. After doing some research I found that the HDMI port was possibly damaged or broken so I ordered a new one and put it in. After I put in the new one I went to plug it in and it still didn't have a display but I realized that I had damaged the new port when installing. I then proceeded to order another one because they are relatively cheap. When the new one came I put it in with great success and did not damage the port this time. When I plugged it in and went to turn it on it now for some reason has no sign of life. I mean, when I press the power button it does not turn on at all ( no beeps, no lights). I have tried all of the Sony recommended troubleshooting with no success. Some of the ones that I have tried include: unplugging it for 2 minutes and plugging it back in, moving it to a different outlet, and unplugging the HDMI port and plugging it back in. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",PS4,1

"Anytime I plug a Hard Drive into my PS4 it disconnects mid game Hi all. 

I have been trying to search for solutions for this on the internet but I have yet to find anything. Anytime I plug in an external hard drive to my PS4 it ends up saying it was disconnected improperly and that I need to repair it. In 2018 I bought an extended storage (1 TB Toshiba) drive and it worked fine for about a year and a half. When me and my girlfriend would play Call of Duty the drive would disconnect about once a week. Then it started happening every time we played making it unusable. I tried to reformat the drive and reinstall games but neither worked. I also made sure that power was given to the USB 24/7. After a while I assumed the drive was broken, detached it and erased a bunch of games. So this last week I bought a new 500 GB hard drive that's compatible with PS4, plugged it in, formatted it, installed Call of Duty and the first thing that happened when I opened Call of Duty was the Hard Drive Disconnected improperly and needs to be repaired. If anyone has any tips on how to fix this or knows what the issue is any tips would be great. I can't have Call of Duty on the internal storage as it simply takes up way too much space.

"After some thought, I’m kind of relieved that the PS5 is out of stock everywhere, and that Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed. (More details in post) I was really bummed when Cyberpunk 2077 got delayed, again, but now, it has all kind of worked out for the best.

Because of the delay, I was able to purchase both Watch Dogs Legion and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla in November. These two games will occupy my time for *months*.

I won’t likely be getting a PS5 until early 2021. The plus side of this is it allows stability and QoL patches to come out on the PS5, ironing out any initial issues. In addition, my plan is to have Cyberpunk 2077 be the first truly “next-gen” game I play on my PS5. (I worry that the game will not perform well on current gen.)

All in all, yes I am sad that this Christmas I will have neither a PS5 nor Cyberpunk 277. However, I don’t think I want to rush into purchasing a next-gen console immediately, or play Cyberpunk 2077 on current gen.

Legion and Valhalla are two awesome games, and finally experiencing CP2077 on next gen hardware will be remarkable.",PS4,1

I own a physical version of MK11 (region 2) and a digital version of MKXL (region 1).

I had no clue that I should've bought dlc with same region account and now neither can have my money back (due to Sony's policy) nor can play any of those characters.

I  contacted with Sony's Support and explain them the problem I'm facing with but apparently It takes a while to have a response from them.

"Update to laggy Remote Play on PS4 Pro This is an update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/jchppf/ps4_pro_remote_play_laggy_af_after_800_update/

I wanted to create a new thread for visibility and to get some more feedback for my own curiosity.

I believe this issue has been fixed (or at least improved) in PS4 software update 8.0.1. There wasn't anything in the changelog about RP specifically, and I never received any reply to the support ticket I originally opened, but after updating to 8.0.1 RP is basically back to what it was pre-8.0.0. It is still a little janky at 1080p High FPS, but prior to the update it was effectively unusable entirely so there is an obvious improvement, at least for me. There hasn't been any update that I have seen to the PS Remote Play app so I believe the fix was on the PS4 end.

Incidentally, I tried Remote Play on my PS5 as well and at launch it would say it was running at 1080p but the pixelation was horrific. After the latest update (20.02-02.25.00) it appears to be running at the correct resolution again and seems very playable. I suspect the fix was the same for both systems.

Has anyone else noticed these changes before and after the update?",PS4,1

"Advice needed on PS4/PS5 jump So after being a day one loyalist until PS3, I made the questionable decision to move to Xbox One during this generation. I have the original model from 2013, the one without 4k or UHD, and have been waiting for the PS5 for about 12 months now.

Unfortunately, I live in India. We don't even have a release date. Plus my Xbox went kaput a few weeks ago, so I'm currently without a console and I don't game on PC.

Combined with that and the issues I'm seeing about the hardware (like the DualSense controller triggers going haywire), I'm wondering if anyone had an opinion on whether it'd be wise to pick up a PS4 Pro and wait 12-18 months to get a PS5.

"Is ""Monopoly Family Fun Pack"" any good? Just like every life defining decision making ever recorded in the history of mankind, it started with me beating the meat 4 hours before college until suddenly in a bliss of the moment from a thought out of nowhere I decided to buy a Monopoly game for ps4 from local e-store. Unlike my usual purchase, I didn't conduct any research with ""what could go wrong with buying a digital version of an established board game that has been around since forever"" mentality in mind. 

Turns out there are couple of red flags. First it made by ubisoft, it also got ridiculously bad reviews on both metacritic and steam. Some also mention on how it benefits one player in every playthrough. It's still on shipping and I already regret it. I wanted to sell it online right after I got the game but unfortunately there is a little to no demand on this game in the local online store. 

I got it for mere $10 equivalent, but it's worth 14 plates of good meal in this third world country. Or 8 packs of decent cigarette. So if there is any consolation, is there anything worth in this game? I'm looking forward to play it locally with my friends, not online at all.",PS4,1
"HELP!! My PS4 Pro is being weird.  I've had my PS4 Pro for just over 3 years and I've never really had any problems with it, but I recently upgraded to a 4k monitor and now the console has been giving me no end of issues. The first few days of playing in 4k were fine but then my console started to be really laggy, it's gotten to the point where I've had to stick my setting back to 1080p... Things like Ghost of Tsushima has lag while loading and during cutscenes. My Rainbow Six Siege barely even loads and all of my clips lag and stutter. Aswell as my console just being generally slow, but this problem only persists when playing in 4k, running in 1080p the console works fine.

"HELP: PS4 does not work after MULTIPLE wipes. Ok so, I've had this PS4 for a while now, and I have no idea what's wrong with it. We're thinking about just waiting and getting a PS5, but I still wanna try to fix this one for shits and giggles. If I can't I'm just gonna move on with my life, but I wanna see if I can get some help from the lovely world of the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

So me and my brother shared the console for about a year and its in very good physical condition. However, I have no idea what's wrong with it software-wise. I wiped the hard drive through a windows, a macbook, wiped the hard drive through safe mode, initialized a bunch of times, and it still does not work. Now your probbaly saying well hey, you probably just have a dead hard drive: nope. I formatted the PS4 hard drive as a external drive for my Macbook, and what do you know, when I transfer a file over to the hard drive, it actually transfers FASTER then majority of my usb drives. The farthest I have gotten is actually setting the console up, but it ends up being INCREDIBLY slow and laggy, almost to a point where I cannot even use the console. So whats going on, and what can I do? If its not the hard drive, what could it be? Thanks",PS4,1

Now with update 8.00 out a few weeks back, my account is totally fucked. My messaging doesn't work, I can't contact anybody there. I can't friend anybody. And I don't even manage my own wallet on my own console. So I made a new account (let's just nickname it 2 and the first account 1) and 2 has the perfect age and I went over everything and it's all perfect. Now, how the he do I transfer data between the two? I understand trophies probably aren't which is the least of my concerns, my most concerning being my DLC and shit. I NEED to transfer all my stuff and I'm actually so fed up with this account 1.

 So I tried contacting PlayStation support, first of all they told me nothing the first time I went in and they removed me from the chat for no reason (yeah I know if you use ""foul"" language they can kick you BUT I DIDNT) and they just kicked me randomly. Second person, he told me the most i can transfer was offline data saves. So I ask how do I do that. And he kicks me out. So then I try again and they tell me nothing useful AGAIN.

"anti aliasing issues on Ps4 Slim Hey, I hope that this is the right place to ask this question...

In some games I noticed really bad anti aliasing problems - namely Horizon, Uncharted 4 (absolutely terrible), God of War 4, GTAV.... but Death Stranding or Resident Evil 7 are looking much much better - still I can notice some little anti aliasing issues there too... 

and when I take a screenshot in any of these games and then transfer it to USB to view on my computer, smartphone or the same TV the quality is incredible - anti aliasing is there 100% and edges are pretty smooth.

Obviously I am interested to know what is the problem here. Is there any way to get the anti aliasing working on my TV in all games? Do I have to purchase some special HDMI cable? lol sorry I am not into tech so maybe this sounds dumb to some of you.

"Bloodborne Remastered theory  

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/808097053?t=0h7m56s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/808097053?t=0h7m56s)

7:54 start

Summary of evidence supporting the Bloodborne Remastered theory (credit to Max's video posted earlier):

* Bluepoint specifically tagged Max in their recent ""Wish you were here"" tweet about the door; Max is known for his love of Bloodborne
* The phrase ""A symphony of rumors"" comes from a Bluepoint tweet from 2019 which included a .gif of a Blood Moon and references ""not one, but two"", possibly indicating that they were working on two projects at that time: Demon's Souls PS5, and something else
* ""A symphony of rumors"" could refer to the ""Music of Demon's Souls"" video Sony released, which features a symphony as well as direct mention of Bloodborne by the soundtrack's orchestrator
* In the remake, there is now a huge full moon over the second stage of the Tower of Latria (the most Bloodborne-esque area of the game)
* In the nexus as well as other parts of the remake, you can sometimes hear strange and ominous noises that were not present in the original - this is another similarity to Bloodborne, which is well known for its unsettling soundscape full of disturbing noises like distant weeping and unseen crying babies.
* Bloodborne also has a door that can be interacted with but is impossible to open - the new door in Demon's Souls may be a direct reference to this
* Bluepoint recently liked then quickly un-liked a tweet from Lance MacDonald about this whole mystery, who is most recently known for modding Bloodborne to run at 60fps on PS4 Pro
* Bluepoint's parting message in the credits of Demon's Souls includes the following sentence: ""It became our honor to devour that nightmare and remake this dream"" - a clear reference to Bloodborne

Basically, there are way too many connections to Bloodborne for it to just be coincidence. Furthermore, it's clear from Bluepoint's behavior that they absolutely drop hints like this on purpose, so we shouldn't ignore them.

Based on this evidence, this is what I believe:

* After the release of SotC, Bluepoint started on Demon's Souls as their main project, using the original source code obtained from FromSoftware as a base
* At some point, they also acquired the original source code to Bloodborne and began working on a remastered version as a second project of smaller scope
* In the near future, Bloodborne Remastered will be announced for PS5 - possibly at the Game Awards, but only possibly
* The timing of the announcement may depend on how quickly the community is able to unravel the mystery of the Ceramic Coins

To be honest, I feel like the Bloodborne fanbase is far larger than the Demon's Souls fanbase, and Bluepoint still saw that small but passionate group of people and decided to invest a ton of money and effort into giving it the ground-up remake treatment. If they were able to justify remaking Demon's Souls, they should definitely be able to justify remastering Bloodborne.

There is simply no way Bluepoint isn't aware of the demand for an enhanced re-release of Bloodborne. That much I can say for certain.",PS4,1

"Play from the Past #1 | Horizon: Zero Dawn [Game Discussion Thread] &amp;#x200B;

Last Tuesday, you have voted for the PS4 classic you wanted to discuss. A lot of big games were represented, and the vote was narrow. But in the end, one of the most beloved exclusives from the PS4 got the little extra that pushed it on top.

[Horizon: Zero Dawn opens this new weekly thread!](https://preview.redd.it/92e5xkhdq1061.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d6471b1e1daf83cde114095e3a60dca1822f3d)

After staying in the first-person shooters genre for nearly than 10 years, Guerrilla Games took a big risk when they announced an open-world RPG with a unique setting, through an entirely new IP. Released in 2017, **Horizon: Zero Dawn** was applauded by the industry and by the players, receiving numerous awards. Praised for its story, graphics, soundtrack, setting and gameplay, it's no surprise that Horizon always ends up in a recommended list of games for any new PlayStation owner, may it be a PS4 or a PS5.

Being a large commercial success with over 10 million copies sold, **Horizon: Zero Dawn** came to PC last summer, three years after its original release, and will get a sequel in 2021, **Horizon II: Forbidden West**, to be released exclusively on PlayStation.

"Weird blod symtoms , ps4 pro My ps4 has been out of commission for a year now. Ants got in my power supply and did some damage . I bought a new one recently. Didn't get the correct model. I needed ADP 300 cr. I got a ADP 300 fr. Did some testing and manage to wire it directly to the PCB.

Now it boots up , before it wouldn't even beep. But it shuts off automatically. It seems the longer I leave the system off the better chance of it booting. But when it shuts off . the blue light stays steady for a bit then dies. The fan doesn't start when this happens. If I leave it over night the next boot the fan starts then I get into a game play for 5 mins or so then it shuts off. 

I'm starting to think its faulty solder joints on apu, but I'm not sure. I tried adding some washers but it still says the same thing.

Also I got a random ""out of range "" signal message on my monitor once while testing. 

I'm baffled as to what this may be. Power seems fine but the biggest clue I got is whenever the system boots up it it works for a bit then shuts off, then it won't turn on immediately after until it is well rested or so it seems. 

Could this be a overheating issue? Can a ps4 shut off 5 mins after start up due to overheating? Would make sense if it won't turn on immediately after but until its properly cooled. 






TLDR :ps4 starts on cold boot only once then shuts off automatically, on immediate reboot fan doesn't work until system is rested for some time. The longer it stays rested the better chance to power on normally",PS4,1

"Thoughts about base model PS4 performance with Cyberpunk 2077? Hello folks,

I've been a little concerned. I bought my PS4 about a year ago and I made a big mistake. I got the regular PS4 instead of the Pro which was only like £50 more at the time. I was pretty new to PS4s then and I was told the Pro was for 4k. As I didn't have a 4k TV I just got the regular PS4.

Ever since learning more about it, I'd been kicking myself regretting not getting the Pro. In fact, I was going to buy a Pro when Death Stranding came out (the Death Stranding special edition one from GAME).. but didn't and again, I'm regretting not buying one of those as there's literally no PS4 Pros in shops now.

At this stage, I'm thinking I'd maybe be best forgetting about the Pro and just buying a PS5 because it will presumably play all the PS4 games I have and will be of even higher performance than PS4 Pro. Would this be best thing for me to do?

However, I wasn't in a huge rush to get a PS5.. of the initial releases there's really nothing that interests me except maybe Godfall.. I was just going to buy one when some more exclusives were released or maybe a special edition console, I could wait for PS5 but my only issue is Cyberpunk 2077. I've been hoping for this game for ages.. and I've just got my regular PS4.

Maybe someone with some technical knowledge could weigh in.. do you think Cyberpunk 2077 run okay on this hardware? Or could it be testing the limits of the base model PS4? Or will we simply not know until release? I've recently been playing AC Valhalla and Ghost of Tsushima, if Cyberpunk plays as good as those I'll be very happy!

I recall there were similar concerns for God of War and the regular PS4 held up fine.. in fact, on side by side comparisons of PS4 and PS4 Pro it was basically impossible (at least for me) to see any big difference. Will it be the same for Cyberpunk 2077? Has there been any footage or information released by CD Projekt Red regarding PS4 models? I really hope the base PS4 is okay for it. 

Many thanks in advance.",PS4,1

"How to fix error (SU-41350-3) when reinstalling the system software? Just bought a 1TB hard drive for my sisters PS4 Slim. Installed it with no issue but have spent the last 2 hours getting the same error when I try to reinstall the system software. Here's what I have done so far, please tell me if I'm missing something because I'm at a loss.
Side note I KNOW the hard drive is compatible with the PS4. 

1. Removed old drive and installed new one from console.
2. Downloaded version 8.01 of the system software reinstallation. 
3. Took a blank flash drive and formatted it to FAT32 (I have tried exFAT as well with no luck either) 
4. Made a folder named ""PS4"" on that flash drive. Made a folder inside that folder that says ""UPDATE"" and saved the reinstallation file in the UPDATE folder as ""PS4UPDATE.PUP"" 
5. Ejected it from PC. 

And yet every single time I select option 7 in Safe Mode (Initialize PS4 (Reinstall System Software)) I get the exact same error that says ""Cannot find the update file. (SU-41350-3).""

I'm at a loss guys. I've tried every fix I could find online. Poured through Youtube video comment sections of people who had figured it out trying to find out what I've done wrong. At this point I'm 99% convinced it's a console issue or something but I wanted to try this as a last resort. Any help would be so appreciated. Thank you.",PS4,1

Is it at all possible to live stream the PS4 *from* the living room *to* the Roku TV? I like to game at night sometimes in my room and I hate having to unplug and plug back in, also hate having to move my PS4 so much.

"Is there any downside to using USB audio as opposed to an HDMI audio extractor? I have a sole goal of getting audio by itself. My setup is weird. I have a mixer - a Yamaha MG06X - solely to route all audio from my PC and monitor to the same speakers and headphones. My monitor takes HDMI in but its aux port only outputs audio from the currently selected output. Meaning, if I’m on HDMI 1 where my PS4 is connected, I can use the aux port just as I want. 

However, I got the mixer so I can hear my PC while on my PS5, so I need audio to be separate somehow. 

In comes this question. I can spend $40 to get a current HDMI 2.0 audio extractor that would let me run audio from the extractor to anywhere I need. Which is fine for right now seeing as I don’t currently use any HDMI 2.1 things and wouldn’t be adversely effected, however, it is more costly at $40. 

There’s also USB. I can spend like $10 just to essentially “convert” one of my USB ports into an auxiliary port and just utilize audio that way. 

Is there any harm in doing this? Thanks!",PS4,1

"Why does everyone want the PS5 so much when that means buying new games? Honest question, I've only owned a ps4 since Friday and am very new to gaming. 

I didnt know the ps5 was out when I went to get my ps4. Past few days I've cultural absorbed some info about the ps5 and I honestly don't understand why people want it? I've already spent like 200 bucks on games the psst few days. The average gamer seems to own more games than I do. So they've probably spent 300+ dollars on games. Those games aren't usable on the ps5, right? So are yall re buying all your old games? If they are even out on ps5- aren't there only a few games so far? 

Does it really look that much better? Maybe it's because I'm a newbie, but I think every so far on my ps4 looks gorgeous. Wouldn't your tv quality matter more? 

These are honest questions, I'm not snarking, just very curious. I adore my ps4, the past 5 days I've had a lot of fun.

"PS4 pad moving opposite direction I move the stick I have a problem with 2 almost brand new, hardly used PS4 pads; they are the newer version with the blue light bar on the touch pad. 
I am totally aware of usual analog stick drift caused by wear and tear but this seems different. 
The weird thing I can’t understand is that when I move the analog stick very slightly to the right by about 1mm, the stick moves to the left as if I’m pushing the stick left.

Can anyone explain how this could happen please?
I will be looking to try taking them apart and see if that helps but it’s almost as if there’s crossed wires or contacts which to me seems totally different to the stick being worn and moving on it’s own in a direction because it’s loose or dirty. 

I have a couple of the original style pads that I’ve had since just after console launch and they have been really abused hard, yet still function pretty well considering. 
One of my new pads with the problem is white and I’ve been pretty meticulous about not getting it dirty or sweaty etc and being rough with it, yet it does this where moving the stick slightly right seems to activate the sensor to move the stick left for the first 1mm or so of movement until I push it further. 

Any advice, suggestions or explanations please guys? It’s driving me mad not understanding it &lt;3

"Just bought “Power A” PS4 controller charging station So I’ve always let my PS4 recharge my controllers one at a time with the cable on rest mode and lately it’s like it’s not charging them plus the cable is old and worn.

So today I bought the aforementioned product. I’m docking the controllers, and I’m pretty sure both are dead. I know one is.

Once you dock is the light supposed to stay on the whole time? Or does it come on and then go off? Cause I don’t feel like they’re locked in there but they have to be in right position because I’m getting a light....",PS4,1

"Where did all the PS4 Slims go? I was hoping for some black friday deals on a new PS4 slim, like last year ($200 for the 1TB slim), but none have turned up so far.  So, I've been looking online, and none of the major retailers in my area even have any new ones available for sale anymore - not Best Buy, not Target, not even Gamestop.  Some of them are still selling the PS4 Pro, and some places do have refurbs for sale, but I'm not really interested in those.

It seems a bit unbelievable that all of the PS4s just disappeared from my major metropolitan/suburban area overnight.  My hope is that maybe they are being held back for some kind of Cyber Monday deal instead?  

My fear is that it is possible that Sony has required sellers to hold them back, to encourage sales of the PS5...  Although, that seems kind of ridiculous as well, considering how hard it is to get a PS5 from any retailer.",PS4,1

"The PS4 is definitely not built for longevity. If a dozen of CE30022-7’s a month isn’t enough, then maybe, just maybe you’ll get slapped by a SU-42118-6. Do you not have enough storage? Why not plug in an external HD like a Western Digital or a Seagate, which will self-destruct by the slightest touch and will also corrupt your console causing database rebuilding complications, etc, because Sony can’t make an official one. Can’t boot up safe mode? Its probably because you don’t own a working Micro-USB, which are prone to excessive bending, and internal frying, thus making you have to buy one every so often. Copying downloads? No worries. Just wait that extra hour. Don’t have enough room to download a tiny update? Just delete the game you just bought a week prior. Rebuilt your database because of a corrupted external HD and your internal HD games are corrupted? Don’t worry, just wait a day for it to re-copy the add-ons. Power outage due to a storm? Who cares, just re-download all of your data if the fragile console bugs out due to it. People saying that your console is broken when you complain?

"Capture length question I'm brand new to the PS4 (specifically Pro) life after being an XB1 person for the entire generation, and I have what'll likely be a dumb question regarding captures.  


So I'm used to my Xbox where I have it set for a 2 minute replay and (functionally) unlimited manual capture. I've been trying to do manual captures, and noticed how every single time the capture stopped after about 3 minutes, so I dug into the settings, realized how I set the length option to 3 minutes, thinking it only impacted replays. Does this single option control both manual *and* replay length? I'd love to have longer manual captures without having hour long replays.",PS4,1

I bought you day one with my first ever credit card. I've dropped hot chocolate on you, kicked you around, thrown you in the boot of my car for cross country journeys to uni friends houses for FIFA tournies. I've experienced the best gaming days of my life, relied on you for escapism and taken you with me everywhere I've moved. You've been the hub of every house I've lived in, with countless hours of movies and series watched on you. 

And yet you've never once faltered to this day. Who knows what the future holds for you - but I don't think your playing days are over, just because there's a new lad in town. 

I hope everyone takes a moment to remember how much these machines have given us over the years! Let me know your best PS4 memories :)

EDIT; Apologies if anyone is annoyed by this - just wanted to appreciate the amazing piece of Technology Sony made for us in the PS4!

"PS4 Slim + TCLDP600 (4K tv) renders very dark HDR Hey there,

I was fooling around with my PS4 parameters yesterday, and I remembered I had HDR off despite having a fairly new 4K TV. My previous TV could not render HDR so I didn't bother too much. I'm also kind of a newbie with HDR, so I don't actually know much about it.

Anyway. I tried activating HDR on my PS4, and calibrating it with the 3 step ""adjust until logo almost disappears""  thing, then I launched a game. At launch, my TV switched canal and properly displayed ""HDR10"", which means it is able to render HDR I guess?

However, the whole screen was very dark, making the games super unpleasant to play. I tried modifying the parameters of my TV, and to increase brightness. It did make the image brighter, but the whites were waaay too bright, to the point I could read texts written with white on the background.

I browsed google / reddit for a little while, and saw that most TVs require ""specific"" parameters to properly render HDR, but I couldn't find anything for my TV, and messing around with the parameters didn't seem to help much.

Does anyone have any idea what I could do to make it work properly? Not that it is super important for playing (I guess?) but I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong, and properly see the difference with HDR off/on.

Thanks!",PS4,1

"Noticeable controller delay in games compared to Xbox one games? I’ve noticed in several games that there is a slight controller delay that isn’t present in the same games I have on Xbox one. I decided to forego my Xbox one for a PS4 pro for better graphics, and since Xbox games will be on PC anyways I figured I could just build a gaming pc to play pc and Xbox games, and use the PS4 for exclusives and a few console games I enjoy playing in the living room.

So far I’ve found several games that have controller lag on ps4 but play perfect on the Xbox one and I’m not sure why this is.

The games in question are:

Payday 2, Minecraft, The Division 1-2, Hitman Blood Money HD, GTA V, Duke Nukem 3D 20th anniversary, and a few others as well.

"Someone’s headphones keep connecting and disconnecting to my PS4. Is there any way I can prevent this from happening? For context, I live in a somewhat huge house with lots of small apartments. I have no idea how long the distance is that PS4 is able to connect with other devices, so I don’t know which apartments I should start asking from. I also do not know my neighbours, and would love to avoid talking to them if there is any chance for that. 

So what happens when I start playing? I usually play without any headphones, but after a while I might get a small notification in upper left corner letting me know that headphones are connected. Usually they stay connected for max. two-three seconds, after which I get a disconnection notification. 

At first when this started happening I thought that this would be something that would cause the headphone owner some confusion as well, but it does not seem to be the case. I have had this happen dozens of times a day for weeks now. So probably they are completely unaware of it happening. At first I didn’t mind, but now as it has been going on for a while, it is starting to tick me. I am just wondering why does my PS4 allow automatically form pairs with electronic devices i have never used?

"Rebought cod mw but it’s still not working I got cod mw on disc and I don’t feel like explaining the whole thing again but long story short the game started crashing my system. When I had it installed the console was extremely slow, laggy? Buggy and all you can ever imagine. Until I deleted the game off my console it was running smooth again. So I decided to give it another try. I downloaded it on the console but every-time it was at the copying data part the download would always reset to 0. And it messed up again. 

I thought it was the the disc version messing it up only. I did notice my system was scratching up my disc very very badly which made me wanna break the console for doing that shit.

"BLACK OPS PS4 Controller Issue(2020) [#fix] to save you some time: change your device settings (controller) to USB connection and plug in FROM COLD START aka ps4 OFF. This fixed issue for me, at least for now.

@activision @ps4 @sony

Jeeeez! Shortly after downloading Call of Duty Black Ops (2020) My PS4 Dualshock controllers were disconnecting like many of you may have experienced upon competing campaign mission 3 (jaw).

After thinking this was a benign glitch, resetting my controllers, and killing my console via power button which I don’t like doing....
I finally took to the inter-webs to see that Activision had already communicated this with an issue many were facing.

After some trial and error, I felt compelled to post this for others who may be chomping at the bit to play the new CoD only to find themselves unable.

Right now it seems to be a Bluetooth issue. I was able to remedy this by plugging in my newest most up-to-date PS4 controller and switching the device settings to USB only.

After nearly 2 days of my controllers not working at all I have so far been able to play the whole campaign and zombies for hours as long as I stay USB WIRED IN. Haha.. hope it helps

P.S. SONY, y’all... Millions of stuck at home waiting for this game, please make it work properly!

Love,

"PS4 doesn’t connect to controllers? So this just happened to me and I cannot find a solution anywhere. 

I was just starting up a game of the new zombies on Call of Duty Cold War and when it asks you to pick your classes. Well my controller, which was plug in, wouldn’t work. The light blue light was on but not the regular dark blue. 

I think to myself that’s strange and turn of the console using the button. The PS4 boots up with the press of the PS button on the controller but when the screen that reads “Press PS Button to Continue” appears, that’s where the problem starts again. During this time the light blue light is on the controller but never becomes a dark blue light as the controller does not connect. 

Any solutions, advices, tips, or tricks are welcome.

Update: After turning off the playstation by unplugging the power cord it would connect to the controllers. I went back to playing Cold War, played one of zombies no issues, load up second game, and on the exact same class selection prompt was up, the dead not connected controller issue starts up again.
